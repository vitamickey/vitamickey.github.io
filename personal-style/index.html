Personal style imo is a mix of:\nKnowing what works That is, using systems with a basis in some kind of theory.\nColour theory Seasonal colour analysis Enter: seasonal colour analysis. Uses the colour of YOU to figure out what colours theoretically complement you best. I am a dark autumn because I have:\n “warm” skin? (see below)  I like gold-toned jewellery more than silver.   med-high contrast  black hair, v dark brown but basically black eyes, against lighter skin   medium chroma  I am not very saturated, but I am not totally desaturated in colouring.    Very popular to do colour analysis in SK but actual colour analysis sessions are SO EXPENSIVE yoinks\nLinks:\n https://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/dark-autumn-a-comprehensive-guide  General comments on colour theory SKINTONE and UNDERTONE what even is this there is not really a consensus on how to categorise skintone and undertone?? I would say I have a yellow skintone with an olive undertone. I am yellow, I am green. And this makes me warm overall?? but my undertone is cool. So, idk. I DON’T THINK OLIVE IS A SKINTONE?????????\ntechnically for seasonal colour analysis you’re supposed to consider your skin UNDERTONE but I like to consider the overall impression of my skin’s colour. I think bc I have olive undertones, I like to lean towards navy a LOT as a neutral in my wardrobe bc it works for me.\nHow this influences my clothing choices My general wardrobe colour palette:\n  From Pinterest\n  HOWEVER COMMA my main colours are\n black (I don’t like vintage black so much, should be a pure black) navy (warmer, greener undertones, rather than purple or ultramarine) brown (all variations, but warmer undertones are better)  beige   red (deeper, medium saturation) greens (either light olive/lime or mostly dark greens) yellow (a deep-ish mustard-ish but not typical mustard?? idk) pink (deeper)  I want more\n purple! (deeper purples)  and I avoid\n burnt orange (don’t ask me why, I just don’t like it even though it’s technically in my colour palette) light blues (except for my light wash jeans which tbh I might get rid of soon) bright anything colours that are too desaturated grey (unless it’s warm like cozy elephant vibes) tan?? (it’s too close to my skintone makes me unfomy sometimes)  Body type Kibbe body types I’ve read a lot of Cozy Rebekah’s blog posts about this lol. I think I’m soft classic?? but people notoriously categorise themselves as this when they’re actually a theatrical romantic, or soft gamine. I still don’t know, and it’s been years. Anyway, pretty controversial method of body typing. Has pros and cons.\nDressing for your “body shape”?? Like, if you’re a “pear”, then you need to wear things that appear to make your shoulders broader and your hips or thighs slimmer.\nGeneral comments on body type I like the Kibbe idea of complementing your features rather than “negating” them like in a typical “dress for your shape” guide. In a typical “dress for you shape” situation, you’re trying to negate things to achieve the ideal “hourglass” figure. But Kibbe says, EMBRACE THE AESTHETIC.\nPast experience I know I like certain cuts of clothing, and I don’t like others\nClothing aspects I like  high waists wide legs collars crew necks long shorts  Clothing aspects I avoid  Silver hardware Rose gold hardware (I could write an essay about my dislike for rose gold) asymmetry?  eg. wrap dresses   thick waistbands on clothing  eg. pants with two buttons on the waistband, just, any thick waistband.   sleeves:  too short (I don’t shave so this can cause issues) raglan   necklines:  boat scoop turtleneck mock neck   exposing my waist or too much thigh  Knowing what you want Generally, figure out what you want your style to be I guess?? Like, I want my style to be a certain way.\n comfy easy poppin  Aesthetics uwu Just using pinterest and seeing what sticks LOL. Brings me back to tumblr. Are you a bruh girl or a hi girl?? Also see Cozy Rebekah\n dark academia Parisian fairycore cottagecore?  TRends? It’s fun to try trends (normally can be found in op shops) and to see what you actually like long-term or if it’s just a fad. Eg. I was into layering camis over shirts, and that has found mild longevity in my wardrobe, but I probably won’t buy more camis for this purpose, since I don’t really like wearing them alone.\nKnowing what you actually wear I recently thought about it, and the stuff I reach for on a daily basis is just comfy stuff. Big zip-up jumpers, with a pair of high-waisted, typically wide-legged pants or jeans, with a t-shirt.\nMy uniform Advice from https://youtu.be/yxz4FCSDjIs is to find a “uniform”, i.e. a go-to outfit you wear often. Like, if you were a cartoon character, what would you wear?\nTypically: pants, t-shirt tucked into pants, jacket (even in summer bc aircon gets cold), with converse or my mary jane docs.\nBalancing act So, I guess there are three aspects:\n What works, your theoretical style What you want, your dream style What you wear, your current style  And your personal style falls somewhere in the middle of these three things.\nIn the end, WEAR WHATEVER U WANT.\n","wordCount":"899","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://michaelacheong.com/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2022-07-07T11:47:21+10:00","dateModified":"2022-07-09T19:51:21+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://michaelacheong.com/personal-style/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Michaela","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://michaelacheong.com/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://michaelacheong.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://michaelacheong.com/img/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=50>Home</a>
