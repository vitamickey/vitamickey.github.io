      <description>To be honestly, this note was one of the main reasons I wanted to make a website: so I could easily link friends and family to resources about ethical fashion, without me necessarily dumping an entire essay into their DMs.
What is ethical fashion? What is fast fashion? </description>

      <description>The Dunning-Kruger Effect is the psychological phenomenon wherein people display a cognitive bias towards their own abilities: those with limited competence or knowledge will overestimate their abilities and demonstrate great confidence in themselves, whilst those with increasing or expert-level competence are reserved in self-confidence as they acknowledge the limitations of their knowledge.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I get this horrible feeling in my stomach. It&amp;rsquo;s happens in a moment where I sort of realise that I am an actual human on the earth. It&amp;rsquo;s a strange sensation. I feel this pit in my stomach, and the world seems a bit too real for a couple of seconds.</description>

      <title>It is better to marry than to burn with passion</title>

      <description>This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today.
 To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)
 Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey.</description>

      <description>On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.
 Do Not Love the World [15] Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [16] For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</description>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do Not Love the World</strong>
[15] Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [16] For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. [17] And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (<a href="https://esv.org/1John2:12%E2%80%9317">1 John 2:15–17, ESV</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have recently been having small groups discussions after church on Sunday evenings as part of our services. It has been wonderful to meet people around the church and engage with them in learning about God&rsquo;s word and being. In our small group time, I got to talk with a couple of the older ladies and an older man from around the church. We were given a question stack similar to, &ldquo;Do you have any favourite things/possessions? Is it okay to have nice things? If God asked you to get rid of them, would you do it?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I expressed how I&rsquo;ve been struggling with taking care for the things I consume in relation to media (i.e., movies, TV shows, music, etc.). I have favourite movies or favourite music, but am unsure whether I would be able to give them up, and often wonder whether they are even helpful (see <a href="https://esv.org/1Corinthians6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>).</p>
<p>One lady talked about how must stuff is rubbish anyway, which I mostly agree with rationally, despite my heart being in opposition most of the time.</p>
<p>Another lady told me about a quote said by our senior pastor once. After looking it up, it was a quote by Corrie ten Boom. There are multiple iterations of this quote, as really Corrie Ten Boom believed in the idea but said it in many different phrasings during her life. The general idea, however, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold all things loosely, because it will hurt you if God must pry them out of your hands.</p>
<p>- <em>Corrie ten Boom</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loss hurts. Change is hard. We like comfort and predictability, not things which are uncertain, new, or potentially dangerous. But God does not call us to live in the comfort of our possessions, our favourite albums, or spacious houses. God gives us things to build us up and enjoy, but will just as easily remove them from our grasp, for the sake of drawing near to him.</p>
<p>I am planning on moving out soon, so the idea of letting things go has been on my mind. I want and I need to get rid of a lot of things before moving out. I am praying that God would help me loosen my grip, so that my loss will count as naught compared to the eternal treasures of heaven that God has in store.</p>

      <description>Origins of the name Michaela Michaela
n. who is like God
Feminine form of Michael (from Hebrew).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaela
A girl from my Youth group wrote this out on a card for me in nice hand-lettering and gave it to me when I got baptised in March of 2021. I honestly hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought about the meaning of my name until then, though I knew that I had been named Michaela based on the biblical angel Michael.</description>

<p>I am definitely not like God. But I do grapple with identity sometimes.</p>
<p>How much of my identity comes from the right things? My identity as a child of God and follower of Jesus might be at the centre of my identity, but how much are my interests, struggles, ideas, appearance, a part of who I am? I would not be who I am without those things, and in a sense they define me, but can I ultimately ascribe my identity as a person to them? I&rsquo;m not sure I know the answers to any of these questions.</p>

      <description>I already have broken my website.
I started with hugo new post/so-it-began.md to create my first post, and then tried to change the folder &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;posts&amp;rdquo;, added a second file with hugo new posts/digital-garden.md, and now it&amp;rsquo;s not showing up on my website. lol.
Thanks to this video for the setup guide tho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4
I am a bit unnerved by the fact that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t merge to the main branch via a pull request and instead commits straight to the main branch.</description>

<p>I am a bit unnerved by the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t merge to the main branch via a pull request and instead commits straight to the main branch. I am 99% sure that is bad git practice.</p>
<p>To build my site, need to use <code>hugo -t PaperMod</code> (or instead of <code>PaperMod</code>, the current website theme).</p>
<p>I need to</p>
<ul>
<li>add comments with Disqus <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/</a></li>
<li>make a stubs page?? <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/stubs/">https://www.mtsolitary.com/stubs/</a> <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/">https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/</a></li>
<li>BACKLINKS??? lol I have a death wish <a href="https://gabrielleearnshaw.medium.com/implementing-backlinks-in-a-hugo-website-e548d3d8f0e0">https://gabrielleearnshaw.medium.com/implementing-backlinks-in-a-hugo-website-e548d3d8f0e0</a> <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/">https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/</a></li>
<li>a search with filters like hugo tania or Maggie Appleton&rsquo;s website would be cool
&ndash; an option to see my posts related to any book of the bible, maybe</li>
<li>ordering by last tended, not by date planted</li>
<li>proper implementation of horticultural extended metaphor</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>To customise CSS and HTML of a theme, you should <strong>override</strong> these rather than edit the themes files directly. The PaperMod files of my website were downloaded onto my laptop and edited directly, which I shouldn&rsquo;t have done. For HTML, images, etc., you can create a new file in the folders of your actual site, rather than the theme&rsquo;s folders. For example, to overwrite <code>head.html</code> stored in <code>/my-site/themes/theme-name/layout/partials/</code> you can copy that file into something like <code>/my-site/layouts/partials/</code> and then the content of that file will overwrite the original file. This is especially important if you have cloned a repository (but that&rsquo;s kinda of obvious, right?). To do that but for CSS, I am referencing Banjo Code.</p>

      <description>A digital garden is a place for thoughts, knowledge and ideas to grow.
The main reference for what a digital garden is comes from Maggie Appleton. I will not follow the original ethos to the T, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice read nonetheless.
For me, the main pull towards maintaining a digital garden is that it&amp;rsquo;s not as intensive as a blog. As outlined in Maggie&amp;rsquo;s writing, a blog requires you to do all of this background research before eventually deciding to release a perfectly manicured opinion to the internet, exerting your intellectual authority onto all who pass through your site.</description>

A digital garden acknowledges that learning is ongoing, and that we will never know everything, or anything, in its entirety.</p>

      <description>I was trying to figure out how to make this website and what exactly it would hold and communicate to the rest of the billions of people with an internet connection. Not that I expect an audience, but once things are out in the world, they stay there. A blog seemed limiting, and I got caught up in a lot of websites recommending I choose a niche and stick to it.</description>

Not that I expect an audience, but once things are out in the world, they stay there. A blog seemed limiting, and I got caught up in a lot of websites recommending I choose a niche and stick to it.</p>
<p>I did already know how I would want to run this website, thanks to my friend Tom who suggested I run my site with Hugo off of Github.</p>
<p>Whilst combing through the Hugo themes on offer, I stumbled across a page about Hugo on Nikita Voloboev&rsquo;s old personal wiki, and then discovered her new wiki and the idea of a Digital Garden.</p>
<p>I had read about all kinds of personal knowledge management systems (PKMs) and related software before. I have tried to stick with Notion for many years now (with wavering success), dipped my toes into Obsidian, maintained a Studyblr back in the mid-to-late 2010s, and read or listened to people talk about second brains, Zettelkastens and atomising information (mostly, SuperMemo&rsquo;s 20 rules of knowledge formation in the context of trying to use Anki, also only mildly successful given I found it difficult to implement in the study of tertiary-level mathematics).</p>
<p>After reading Nikita&rsquo;s writing on digital gardens, and then Maggie Appleton&rsquo;s well-referenced article on their history and ethos, a digital garden seemed like the refreshing middle-ground I had been looking for in wanting to share learning with others in a orderly chaos without it being void of structure but also not strictly chronological. I also didn&rsquo;t want to publish content on something like a blog that made me seem like an authority on anything because, realistically, I am incredibly imperfect and constantly learning. The digital garden acknowledges growth and encourages collaboration. It excites me.</p>
<p>And, quite frankly, the concept of a digital garden also tickled my fancy because it feels rather cute and cottagecore-esque.</p>
<p>Here, there will be learning, messing up, growing up, falling over, brushing off, getting back up, and doing all of that a thousand times. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
