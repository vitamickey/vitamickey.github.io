Mentor: if you come on too strong or judge them too harshly, they will just retreat from you and stop coming to you for advice. Avoid that.
I think I’ve already done this. But I’m gonna try and lovingly reconcile this.</description>

      <description>I had a massive crisis in the middle of my first year of uni. As I grew in my faith and left high school (which was pretty bad for me), I became disillusioned with the idea of studying. What is the point of me spending this time in uni, studying for a degree that isn&amp;rsquo;t a theological degree? I could spend all day studying my Bible but instead I must study linear analysis?</description>

      <description>The effect of boycotting fast fashion on garment workers Thoughts There is a big debate about what would happen to all the garment workers who earn their living off of fast fashion if we boycotted fast fashion companies. Would they be driven into worse industries riddled with exploitation, such as sex-related trades?

      <description>Personal style is key to buying clothes that will stand the test of time.
There are various ways people pin down their personal style (in both clothing and makeup), some being rigorous categorisation systems and other being general ideas and concepts. Personal style imo is a mix of:
Knowing what works That is, using systems with a basis in some kind of theory.

      <description>Questions to ask:
 What have you learned about each other lately — stories, habits, character traits? How have you each grown in your relationship with Jesus since you started dating? Are you both committed to abstaining from any form of sexual immorality? What flags, if any, have others raised about your relationship? What obstacles are keeping the two of you from getting married? Are you each being driven by your own desires, or by God’s desires for you?</description>

  Write everything out
  Make it actionable
physical/visible
  Park it where it belongs
  Review frequently

      <description>I use a bullet journal. Yes, I got into the craze when I was in Year 9 at school and studyblr was taking the internet by storm. It was quite the time.
My first iterations of bujoing I recall being kinda ugly ngl.
Now, I follow the Ryder Caroll method, and not the pretty artsy method. Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with that, in fact, I loved doing that for many years, and it really helped ground me through some pretty dark and dire times.</description>

      <description>OH MAN I have put off doing my tax returns for years now because I don&amp;rsquo;t make a taxable income AND because my identification wasn&amp;rsquo;t working it took me like two years to link my myGov to the ATO. I laugh at myself.</description>

      <description>I feel like a lot of stuff I have been reading or hearing has been about love. That makes sense, given love is the core of who God is. God IS love. Of course I am learning a lot about love.
The classic is 1 Corinthians 13. Anything without love is nothing.
Let all that you do be done in love, 1 Corinthians 16:14.
Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</description>

      <description>17/06/2022
Today, I started reading 2 Corinthians, and like, wow. There are times when I am in awe at God&amp;rsquo;s word, but this was a time where I was TRULY felt so in awe of what I was reading.
In the first half of 2 Corinthians 1, Paul talks about the afflictions and suffering he&amp;rsquo;s gone through. There are a few key truths I have taken from this:
Suffering makes us learn to rely on God I have gone through a lot.</description>

      <title>Praying out loud builds up others</title>

      <guid>http://michaelacheong.com/praying-out-loud/</guid>
      <description>1 Corinthians 14 talks about prayers in tongues. If you pray in tongues, but it is not interpreted, then like, even though it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to pray, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve to build others up in prayer since they don&amp;rsquo;t know what you prayed about. They cannot join in saying &amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; to a prayer that is unknown.
This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve pondered a bit, when I notice people who are inclined to never praying out loud corporately, whether in a small group or in a large group.</description>

      <description>I get the feeling that this is kind of obvious, but I am talking about instances where I have read a passage and gone, &amp;ldquo;Wow, the way that the author talked about their emotions, thoughts, situation, etc. is something I would like to adapt into my life too.&amp;rdquo; So, basically these are all from the epistles but whatevs.

      <description>Disclaimer: totally based on personal experience, and not properly researched. Think of it as pop psychology.
To participate in the Trauma Olympics is to partake in the competition of &amp;ldquo;who has experienced the worst trauma?&amp;rdquo;. What metrics are used? Quantity (how many events, for how long) and quality (how bad was it). This is not a great culture to participate in, but I have found myself falling victim to it from others and equally perpetuating it onto others.</description>

      <description>There are many ways people die, and many ways that death is made public within the confines of the law, depending on where you are in time and space. While Jesus was around, crucifixion, aside from being up there as one of the most painful forms of execution and death, was a public scene of shame and humiliation for whoever was hung upon a cross. There was a strong cultural and social element to it.</description>

      <description>OzCLO is the Australian Computational Linguistics Olympiad. I participated in it during high school. In Grade 10, my junior team beat out the third best senior team in our state, so they actually didn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the national round. In the regional round, we came first for juniors, and then in my senior year we came first in our state (i.e. in the regional round).

      <description>The Dunning-Kruger Effect is the psychological phenomenon wherein people display a cognitive bias towards their own abilities: those with limited competence or knowledge will overestimate their abilities and demonstrate great confidence in themselves, whilst those with increasing or expert-level competence are reserved in self-confidence as they acknowledge the limitations of their knowledge.</description>

 To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)

 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</description>

      <description>A digital garden is a place for thoughts, knowledge and ideas to grow.
The main reference for what a digital garden is comes from Maggie Appleton. I will not follow the original ethos to the T, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice read nonetheless.
For me, the main pull towards maintaining a digital garden is that it&amp;rsquo;s not as intensive as a blog. As outlined in Maggie&amp;rsquo;s writing, a blog requires you to do all of this background research before eventually deciding to release a perfectly manicured opinion to the internet, exerting your intellectual authority onto all who pass through your site.</description>

      <description>I was trying to figure out how to make this website and what exactly it would hold and communicate to the rest of the billions of people with an internet connection. Not that I expect an audience, but once things are out in the world, they stay there. A blog seemed limiting, and I got caught up in a lot of websites recommending I choose a niche and stick to it.</description>
