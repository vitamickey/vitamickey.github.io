      <description>I Basic Counting (pg. 5) 1 Selections (pg. 5) 1.1-1.4 Basic counting formulas Given a set of \(n\) objects, the number of ways of selecting \(r\) objects can be found according to the table below.
No repetition With repetition Order matters (Ordered) \(\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\) \(n^r\) Order does not matter (Unordered) \(\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}\) \(\binom{n+r-1}{r} = \binom{n+r-1}{n-1}\) 1.4 Intuition for unordered selections with repetition This is the balls and buckets representation. If we wish to select \(r\) objects from an \(n\)-set, we essentially want to count the number of ways we can split up the \(n\) objects (i.</description>

      <title>Being a Christian university student</title>

      <description>I had a massive crisis in the middle of my first year of uni. As I grew in my faith and left high school (which was pretty bad for me), I became disillusioned with the idea of studying. What is the point of me spending this time in uni, studying for a degree that isn&amp;rsquo;t a theological degree? I could spend all day studying my Bible but instead I must study linear analysis?</description>

      <description>The effect of boycotting fast fashion on garment workers Thoughts There is a big debate about what would happen to all the garment workers who earn their living off of fast fashion if we boycotted fast fashion companies. Would they be driven into worse industries riddled with exploitation, such as sex-related trades?

      <description>Questions to ask:
What have you learned about each other lately — stories, habits, character traits? How have you each grown in your relationship with Jesus since you started dating? Are you both committed to abstaining from any form of sexual immorality? What flags, if any, have others raised about your relationship? What obstacles are keeping the two of you from getting married? Are you each being driven by your own desires, or by God’s desires for you?</description>

      <description>I use a bullet journal. Yes, I got into the craze when I was in Year 9 at school and studyblr was taking the internet by storm. It was quite the time.
My first iterations of bujoing I recall being kinda ugly ngl.
Now, I follow the Ryder Caroll method, and not the pretty artsy method. Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with that, in fact, I loved doing that for many years, and it really helped ground me through some pretty dark and dire times.</description>

      <description>I feel like a lot of stuff I have been reading or hearing has been about love. That makes sense, given love is the core of who God is. God IS love. Of course I am learning a lot about love.
The classic is 1 Corinthians 13. Anything without love is nothing.
Let all that you do be done in love, 1 Corinthians 16:14.
Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</description>

Today, I started reading 2 Corinthians, and like, wow. There are times when I am in awe at God&amp;rsquo;s word, but this was a time where I was TRULY felt so in awe of what I was reading.
In the first half of 2 Corinthians 1, Paul talks about the afflictions and suffering he&amp;rsquo;s gone through. There are a few key truths I have taken from this:
Suffering makes us learn to rely on God I have gone through a lot.</description>

      <guid>http://michaelacheong.com/praying-out-loud/</guid>
      <description>1 Corinthians 14 talks about prayers in tongues. If you pray in tongues, but it is not interpreted, then like, even though it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to pray, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve to build others up in prayer since they don&amp;rsquo;t know what you prayed about. They cannot join in saying &amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; to a prayer that is unknown.
This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve pondered a bit, when I notice people who are inclined to never praying out loud corporately, whether in a small group or in a large group.</description>

      <description>I get the feeling that this is kind of obvious, but I am talking about instances where I have read a passage and gone, &amp;ldquo;Wow, the way that the author talked about their emotions, thoughts, situation, etc. is something I would like to adapt into my life too.&amp;rdquo; So, basically these are all from the epistles but whatevs.
From Youth camp, Romans 7:21-25. Models a response to our own sinful nature.</description>

Update: 11 of June 2022 MATHS WORKS it&amp;rsquo;s officially complex analysis time, my homies. Actually, I could probably write about slightly lower levels of maths first?? idk. At least maths works. \(i^2 = -1\).

      <title>The Trauma Olympics</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: totally based on personal experience, and not properly researched. Think of it as pop psychology.
To participate in the Trauma Olympics is to partake in the competition of &amp;ldquo;who has experienced the worst trauma?&amp;rdquo;. What metrics are used? Quantity (how many events, for how long) and quality (how bad was it). This is not a great culture to participate in, but I have found myself falling victim to it from others and equally perpetuating it onto others.</description>

      <title>Crucifixion is a form of public shame and humiliation</title>

      <description>There are many ways people die, and many ways that death is made public within the confines of the law, depending on where you are in time and space. While Jesus was around, crucifixion, aside from being up there as one of the most painful forms of execution and death, was a public scene of shame and humiliation for whoever was hung upon a cross. There was a strong cultural and social element to it.</description>

      <description>I think you call this a stack, where you talk about applications you use and their setup. So, I am gonna write a university stack, or a general productivity stack, but this is my VSCode stack, which in essence is a list of extensions I use and my setup.
Colour Theme: Rouge I like navy and the soft pink is really nice. -I also have used Horizon Bright by jolaleye if I ever want to use a light theme (so, not super often, but enough to say I like it as a theme).</description>

      <description>OzCLO is the Australian Computational Linguistics Olympiad. I participated in it during high school. In Grade 10, my junior team beat out the third best senior team in our state, so they actually didn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the national round. In the regional round, we came first for juniors, and then in my senior year we came first in our state (i.e. in the regional round).
I thoroughly enjoyed all of my experiences to do with OzCLO during high school.</description>

      <description>The Dunning-Kruger Effect is the psychological phenomenon wherein people display a cognitive bias towards their own abilities: those with limited competence or knowledge will overestimate their abilities and demonstrate great confidence in themselves, whilst those with increasing or expert-level competence are reserved in self-confidence as they acknowledge the limitations of their knowledge.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I get this horrible feeling in my stomach. It&amp;rsquo;s happens in a moment where I sort of realise that I am an actual human on the earth. It&amp;rsquo;s a strange sensation. I feel this pit in my stomach, and the world seems a bit too real for a couple of seconds.</description>

      <title>It is better to marry than to burn with passion</title>

      <description>This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today.
To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)
Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey. Onwards we go.</description>

      <description>On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</description>

      <description>A digital garden is a place for thoughts, knowledge and ideas to grow.
Reminds me of a second brain, PKM (personal knowledge management system), life wiki, Zettelkasten, all those bigs words. But there is something distinctly cute uwu about the notion of a digital garden.
The main reference for what a digital garden is comes from Maggie Appleton. I will not follow the original ethos to the T, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice read nonetheless.</description>

      <description>I was trying to figure out how to make this website and what exactly it would hold and communicate to the rest of the billions of people with an internet connection. Not that I expect an audience, but once things are out in the world, they stay there. A blog seemed limiting, and I got caught up in a lot of websites recommending I choose a niche and stick to it.</description>
