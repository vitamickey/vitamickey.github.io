      <description>I was trying to figure out how to make this website and what exactly it would hold and communicate to the rest of the billions of people with an internet connection. Not that I expect an audience, but once things are out in the world, they stay there. A blog seemed limiting, and I got caught up in a lot of websites recommending I choose a niche and stick to it.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I get this horrible feeling in my stomach. It&amp;rsquo;s happens in a moment where I sort of realise that I am an actual human on the earth. It&amp;rsquo;s a strange sensation. I feel this pit in my stomach, and the world seems a bit too real for a couple of seconds.</description>

      <title>It is better to marry than to burn with passion</title>

      <description>This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today.
 To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)
 Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey.</description>

      <description>On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.
 Do Not Love the World [15] Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [16] For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</description>

      <description> Lots and lots of collecting all of my God-related thoughts that are randomly scribbled on paper which, while nice, are not easy to look back on sometimes Fonts, typography, favourite fonts Mathematics, subjects I&amp;rsquo;m taking, transfer statistics stuff onto digital garden maybe?? High school, reflections, why it sucked Music, instruments Crochet, yarn and hook stuff Anything from Notion that I sort of don&amp;rsquo;t want in Notion anymore (I am a bit sick of Notion) A rant about Notion Anki setup The difficultiy I have in sticking to systems Bullet journalling (Ryder Carroll basics) Stationery  </description>

      <description>I am an absolute Github noob, but like, I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best.
When I created this website, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I should have created the hugo new site in a cloned repository that was already on my computer, so, I am using the second answer of this stack overflow question to do it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311774/how-to-convert-existing-non-empty-directory-into-a-git-working-directory-and-pus
After some finicking, I now have my Hugo site version control being managed in Git. I think.</description>

      <description>Origins of the name Michaela Michaela
n. who is like God
Feminine form of Michael (from Hebrew).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaela
A girl from my Youth group wrote this out on a card for me in nice hand-lettering and gave it to me when I got baptised in March of 2021. I honestly hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought about the meaning of my name until then, though I knew that I had been named Michaela based on the biblical angel Michael.</description>

      <description>I already have broken my website.
I started with hugo new post/so-it-began.md to create my first post, and then tried to change the folder &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;posts&amp;rdquo;, added a second file with hugo new posts/digital-garden.md, and now it&amp;rsquo;s not showing up on my website. lol.
Thanks to this video for the setup guide tho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4
I am a bit unnerved by the fact that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t merge to the main branch via a pull request and instead commits straight to the main branch.</description>

      <description>A digital garden is a place for thoughts, knowledge and ideas to grow.
I will not follow the original ethos to the T, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice read nonetheless.</description>
