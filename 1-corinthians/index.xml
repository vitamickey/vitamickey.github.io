      <description>I feel like a lot of stuff I have been reading or hearing has been about love. That makes sense, given love is the core of who God is. God IS love. Of course I am learning a lot about love.
The classic is 1 Corinthians 13. Anything without love is nothing.
Let all that you do be done in love, 1 Corinthians 16:14.
Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</description>

      <title>Praying out loud builds up others</title>

      <description>1 Corinthians 14 talks about prayers in tongues. If you pray in tongues, but it is not interpreted, then like, even though it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to pray, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve to build others up in prayer since they don&amp;rsquo;t know what you prayed about. They cannot join in saying &amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; to a prayer that is unknown.
This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve pondered a bit, when I notice people who are inclined to never praying out loud corporately, whether in a small group or in a large group.</description>

      <title>The Bible provides models for articulating responses to our situations</title>

      <description>I get the feeling that this is kind of obvious, but I am talking about instances where I have read a passage and gone, &amp;ldquo;Wow, the way that the author talked about their emotions, thoughts, situation, etc. is something I would like to adapt into my life too.&amp;rdquo; So, basically these are all from the epistles but whatevs.
From Youth camp, Romans 7:21-25. Models a response to our own sinful nature.</description>

      <title>It is better to marry than to burn with passion</title>

      <description>This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today.
To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)
Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey. Onwards we go.</description>

      <description>On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</description>
