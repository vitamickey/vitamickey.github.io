[{"content":"Welcome to my lil\u0026rsquo; digital garden! This is a place where I would like to learn and grow.\nSome places to start on this website would be my post about digital gardens or my first post So, it began on why I made this website.\nThings you should know before trekking through this site What I put here is a living, breathing garden. These things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned, ideas, opinions, essays, etc., are open to change, and open to growth. You can suggest edits to my notes on GitHub in the meta at the bottom of each post. I will try to enable comments soon too.\nNotes here are probably written for me and not for general public consumption, so, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that not everything will make sense. I like to make notes comprehensible enough for myself to understand, though, so hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s not too much of an issue?? Actually, as I have been working on this site, I am naturally making my notes more for general consumption than I intended to, and I guess that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nThere will be a variety of developed (evergreen) notes, vs. budding or growing notes. I would like to adopt some kind of metaphor for growth on this website (like maybe cocoons into caterpillars into butterflies, since I have chosen the butterfly for my website motif), but we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nDigital gardens are not really meant to be chronological or easily navigable. They should be densely linked to each other so that one can trawl through them similarly to how you would in a forest. I would like to get there eventually, but haven\u0026rsquo;t set up a good backlink system yet, so the archive is currently chronological as is the pagination from the home page.\nThis website will be a combination of a personal wiki and a digital garden. Some notes will be titled as things, some will be ideas and declarative statements, some will be abstract titles (I think I have been inspired by vlogbrothers in that regard), and some will be none of those things. If I think too hard about maintaining consistency in my post titles then I will cease to write anything at all.\nIn future, this might become a list of key notes for navigation purposes or to start off. idk.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/welcome/","summary":"Welcome to my lil\u0026rsquo; digital garden!

Personal style imo is a mix of:\nKnowing what works That is, using systems with a basis in some kind of theory.\nColour theory Seasonal colour analysis Enter: seasonal colour analysis. Uses the colour of YOU to figure out what colours theoretically complement you best. I am a dark autumn because I have:\n \u0026ldquo;warm\u0026rdquo; skin? (see below)  I like gold-toned jewellery more than silver.   med-high contrast  black hair, v dark brown but basically black eyes, against lighter skin   medium chroma  I am not very saturated, but I am not totally desaturated in colouring.    Very popular to do colour analysis in SK but actual colour analysis sessions are SO EXPENSIVE yoinks\nLinks:\n https://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/dark-autumn-a-comprehensive-guide  General comments on colour theory SKINTONE and UNDERTONE what even is this there is not really a consensus on how to categorise skintone and undertone?? I would say I have a yellow skintone with an olive undertone. I am yellow, I am green. And this makes me warm overall?? but my undertone is cool. So, idk. I DON\u0026rsquo;T THINK OLIVE IS A SKINTONE?????????\ntechnically for seasonal colour analysis you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to consider your skin UNDERTONE but I like to consider the overall impression of my skin\u0026rsquo;s colour. I think bc I have olive undertones, I like to lean towards navy a LOT as a neutral in my wardrobe bc it works for me.\nHow this influences my clothing choices My general wardrobe colour palette:\n  From Pinterest\n  HOWEVER COMMA my main colours are\n black (I don\u0026rsquo;t like vintage black so much, should be a pure black) navy (warmer, greener undertones, rather than purple or ultramarine) brown (all variations, but warmer undertones are better)  beige   red (deeper, medium saturation) greens (either light olive/lime or mostly dark greens) yellow (a deep-ish mustard-ish but not typical mustard?? idk) pink (deeper)  I want more\n purple! (deeper purples)  and I avoid\n burnt orange (don\u0026rsquo;t ask me why, I just don\u0026rsquo;t like it even though it\u0026rsquo;s technically in my colour palette) light blues (except for my light wash jeans which tbh I might get rid of soon) bright anything colours that are too desaturated grey (unless it\u0026rsquo;s warm like cozy elephant vibes) tan?? (it\u0026rsquo;s too close to my skintone makes me unfomy sometimes)  Body type Kibbe body types I\u0026rsquo;ve read a lot of Cozy Rebekah\u0026rsquo;s blog posts about this lol. I think I\u0026rsquo;m soft classic?? but people notoriously categorise themselves as this when they\u0026rsquo;re actually a theatrical romantic, or soft gamine. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know, and it\u0026rsquo;s been years. Anyway, pretty controversial method of body typing. Has pros and cons.\nDressing for your \u0026ldquo;body shape\u0026rdquo;?? Like, if you\u0026rsquo;re a \u0026ldquo;pear\u0026rdquo;, then you need to wear things that appear to make your shoulders broader and your hips or thighs slimmer.\nGeneral comments on body type I like the Kibbe idea of complementing your features rather than \u0026ldquo;negating\u0026rdquo; them like in a typical \u0026ldquo;dress for your shape\u0026rdquo; guide. In a typical \u0026ldquo;dress for you shape\u0026rdquo; situation, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to negate things to achieve the ideal \u0026ldquo;hourglass\u0026rdquo; figure. But Kibbe says, EMBRACE THE AESTHETIC.\nPast experience I know I like certain cuts of clothing, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like others\nClothing aspects I like  high waists wide legs collars crew necks long shorts  Clothing aspects I avoid  Silver hardware Rose gold hardware (I could write an essay about my dislike for rose gold) asymmetry?  eg. wrap dresses   thick waistbands on clothing  eg. pants with two buttons on the waistband, just, any thick waistband.   sleeves:  too short (I don\u0026rsquo;t shave so this can cause issues) raglan   necklines:  boat scoop turtleneck mock neck   exposing my waist or too much thigh linen :sob:  Knowing what you want Generally, figure out what you want your style to be I guess?? Like, I want my style to be a certain way.\n comfy easy poppin  Style priorities Suggested by Body and Style. Video: How to Stop Buying Trends + Find Your Style | from a stylist. Pinterest board: Style Priorities, Collection by Body \u0026amp; Style\n style priority = message you want to send to the world with your clothes, i.e. how you want to come across   Choose 4 priorities  you can break down these too   Dissect that style  write all elements, regardless of your personal preference for them eg. edgy = chains, leather, metal, lace, black, etc.   Combine elements to find your perfect clothes  combine details from across the list     Take body type and colour season into account? eg. romantic body type should take into account romantic elements. Don\u0026rsquo;t create a mishmash of different elements: create harmony.  Doing the method  Priorities  Academic Retro/60s/70s Elegant/clean/minimal (Currently very) Sporty (Mayyybe) Girl next door/cosy/cute/comfy     Aesthetics uwu Just using pinterest and seeing what sticks LOL. Brings me back to tumblr. Are you a bruh girl or a hi girl?? Also see Cozy Rebekah\n dark academia Parisian fairycore cottagecore?  Essences  Dramatic Natural Gamine Classic Romantic Ingenue (technically scrubbed by Kibbe) Angelic/ethereal  I am not dramatic or natural. I think I am ingenue? Classic? Romantic?\nTRends? It\u0026rsquo;s fun to try trends (normally can be found in op shops) and to see what you actually like long-term or if it\u0026rsquo;s just a fad. Eg. I was into layering camis over shirts, and that has found mild longevity in my wardrobe, but I probably won\u0026rsquo;t buy more camis for this purpose, since I don\u0026rsquo;t really like wearing them alone.\nKnowing what you actually wear I recently thought about it, and the stuff I reach for on a daily basis is just comfy stuff. Big zip-up jumpers, with a pair of high-waisted, typically wide-legged pants or jeans, with a t-shirt.\nMy uniform Advice from https://youtu.be/yxz4FCSDjIs is to find a \u0026ldquo;uniform\u0026rdquo;, i.e. a go-to outfit you wear often. Like, if you were a cartoon character, what would you wear?\nTypically: pants, t-shirt tucked into pants, jacket (even in summer bc aircon gets cold), with converse or my mary jane docs.\nBalancing act So, I guess there are three aspects:\n What works, your theoretical style What you want, your dream style What you wear, your current style  And your personal style falls somewhere in the middle of these three things.\nIn the end, WEAR WHATEVER U WANT.\nAnother style theory: Style Roots A style theory by Body and Style (by Ellie Jean) discovered by me on 2022-07-13.

And when you need something new, make sure it’s something you love.[^2] Discard things that have served their purpose but are no longer loved on a regular basis. If you are doing the laundry and realize a piece of clothing is no longer suitable or enjoyable to wear, go ahead and put it into a donation box right away.[^2] Make a habit of going through your clothes each season and discard those things you haven’t worn.[^2] When you make a purchase, designate a place for that new item when you get home. Don’t set it down and think about it later. Do it right away.[^2] Put things back as soon as you\u0026rsquo;ve used them.  Actual thoughts I REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH STUFF. I know this.

At the start of this year (2022), I watched Crash Course Linguistics, hosted by Taylor Behnke, to get a taste of linguistics before my uni semester started. This year, I took my first linguistics course at uni, which I just barely missed the intake for last year. When the 2022 P4A rolled around, I tuned in, and it just so happened that Taylor Behnke was hosting a few hours of the stream. The event also closely coincided with me starting my linguistics course. So, what better way to spend my money than to support a charity event that excites me than buying a piece of art which also commemorates a turning point in my linguistics journey?\nFruit stickers!!!

No amount of skill-building will help you become fluent.  A2: Roadmap Overview  Build a foundation  Use traditional learning tools for understanding purely (all input, no output). Immersion. Vocab and grammar to aid in comprehension and make meaning.   Develop comprehension  Narrow focus. Choose content that is most comprehensible to you and only study within that content. Develop into being able to understand native level content.   Learn to speak Refine to mastery  Starting is half the battle. The other half is to keep showing up.\nB: Mindset B1: Enjoy the Language Enjoying your immersion content is THE MOST important part of language acquisition.\nDo not force yourself to immerse with content you aren’t interested in.\nIf you’re bored, skip it.\nEnjoyment catalyses acquisition.\nRefold is PURELY A GUIDE\nB2: Tolerate the Ambiguity Get comfortable leaving your comfort zone.\nSkill-building DOES NOT WORK for language acquisition.\nStart slow and build endurance for trying to sit through immersion.\nC: Core Activities C1: Active Immersion Paying full attention to the content you are consuming.\nThe MOST important activity in language acquisition.\n Finding Content  Netflix and Streaming Sites YouTube Other Platforms   Tools  Language Learning with Netflix \u0026amp; YouTube Dedicated TL YT Acc Dedicated TL device    C2: Passive Listening You have plenty of time to do this, whilst doing other tasks like cooking and cleaning.\nReach for this instead of other content.\nRe-listen to content you have actively immersed with.\nGives brain a second chance to listen to same content.\nListen to the sounds of the target language.\nDon’t get discouraged by not understanding.\nIf you get bored, switch it up.\nC3: Active Study Grammar study shows us how to break down the language.\nMemorisation helps in the following three ways:\n Priming  Learning a new word creates a new entry in your mental dictionary. It primes you to recognise it during immersion.   Comprehension  Memorising the meaning of the word fills in the definition in the dictionary.   Retention  Once a word has been seen a lot in immersion, it becomes acquired vocabulary, which is harder to forget. Each dictionary entry must be revisited before its deletion, otherwise you have to build it back up in your memory.    Use an SRS to retain information.\n So, use Anki  Stage 1: Lay the Foundation Foundation is important!\nStage 1A: Setting Up Tools and Habits A1: Active Immersion Aim for 30min/day in TL.\nCan use subtitles in NL to help increase enjoyment of immersion whilst building habit of consuming TL media. Stop using NL subtitles once habit is built.\nAccept ambiguity. It will feel hard/discouraging, but that’s part of learning.\n Limit NL subs Rewatch content you know Watch simpler shows Make it a game  Sounds Words Search for known words (mental dictionary entries)    A2: Passive Listening Quantity and repetition. Replace all that you listen to during mindless tasks with listening.\n Whilst travelling, walking, exercising, doing chores, during morning or bedtime routines Reduce friction by downloading resources)  Listen for words and sounds. It might sound like gibberish, but that’s part of the process.\nA3: Anki Setup Anki setup guide\nBy the end of Stage 1A, you should have Anki set up and you should be immersing with Target Language (TL) content.\nStage 1B: Learning the Building Blocks B1: Phonetics B2: Writing System By the end of Stage 1B, you should be aware of the phonetics of your TL and should have started or completed studying the writing system.

Think of it as pop psychology.\nTo participate in the Trauma Olympics is to partake in the competition of \u0026ldquo;who has experienced the worst trauma?\u0026rdquo;. What metrics are used? Quantity (how many events, for how long) and quality (how bad was it). This is not a great culture to participate in, but I have found myself falling victim to it from others and equally perpetuating it onto others.\nWhen talking about traumatic experiences in life, if others around you have experienced seemingly worse things than you, you can either feel within yourself a minimisation of your own experiences, or be explicitly told, \u0026ldquo;your experiences are not as bad as mine have been\u0026rdquo;. A negative consequence of this is the feeling that one is not allowed to feel as poorly as they do about what they have been through because of its relative okay-ness to those around them.\nIf you sense you have had worse experiences than others, as I often do, you may possibly minimise your own experiences to give others space to share their lesser experiences, or you may tout your own trauma so as to feel better about the sorry state of your life. I do both of these, much to my chagrin.\nReally, I think the solution to the many pitfalls is to be empathetic to one another. If someone is going through something traumatic, or is healing from past trauma, simply be there for the person. Listen, clarify, ask questions, refer them to professionals who can help, check in with them.\nHere is a list of things I avoid saying or doing when someone are sharing emotions, experiences or trauma with me, from my own personal experience of feeling minimised or unsafe in a conversation, as well as what I\u0026rsquo;ve found seems to work:\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone has experienced hardship and goes through tough times.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Look on the bright side: what didn\u0026rsquo;t kill you made you stronger.\u0026rdquo; Talking about how you relate to someone\u0026rsquo;s hardship can sometimes be unhelpful, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t actually experienced similar situations to them, but this varies and depends a lot on the people talking.  For example, for a person talking about their experience with trauma from sexual assault, if the person they are sharing with responds with \u0026ldquo;I can relate, because I have felt pain and trauma during break-ups\u0026rdquo;, that may not be helpful, as those two experiences objectively differ a lot. Not to say one pain is worse than the other (we are trying to avoid that) but there are objective differences between those situations that make the \u0026ldquo;I relate to you\u0026rdquo; sentiment feel ingenuine or misplaced.   \u0026ldquo;But you seem fine, so are your difficulties really that bad, or are you just playing them up?\u0026rdquo;  Everyone feels their experiences differently. The way I feel, experience and deal with past trauma and ongoing traumatic events is totally different to the way my friends would, because everyone has an individual experience of the world and different capacities for dealing with problems. The Trauma Olympics are not helpful, useful, or loving. Let\u0026rsquo;s see each other as individual people and get to know others and their experiences, in love and care for one another, and not in competition against each other.\n Further reading\nWelcome to the Trauma Olympics by Anne Davis\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/trauma-olympics/","summary":"Disclaimer: totally based on personal experience, and not properly researched.

I have also recently been thinking I should pay more attention to the meaning of the songs I listen to, even if they\u0026rsquo;re in a different language. That is going to take\u0026hellip; a lot of work. But I think it will start with filtering out the new songs that come into my sphere of attention and going through the entire discography of Red Velvet and LOONA to sort out the ones I should keep around vs the ones I could chuck.\nThis is gonna take a while. I have already tried to go through LOONA\u0026rsquo;s ++ album and like I\u0026rsquo;m a bit conflicted bc they\u0026rsquo;re all just love songs? I guess most pop songs are about romance. Are the lyrics really that worthwhile? That\u0026rsquo;s why I like listening to K-Pop in large part: you can just enjoy cool sounds without thinking too much about the meaning. But I realised lately that even though I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the meaning, those who know Korean do. I sometimes get irked when people sing along to really bad English songs, but those people also probably just listen to the song bc it sounds good.\n 11/06/2022\nI reached a bit of a breaking point recently, so I am currently on a K-Pop fast. K-Pop songs are in my brain far too much of my life. I am missing a LOONA comeback. See you all in July.\n 15/06/2022\nI still have so much K-Pop song in my brain. It\u0026rsquo;s astounding. But I don\u0026rsquo;t miss it too much. I often find myself start singing a song in my head, and then doing some of the actions (I used to do a lot of K-Pop dance).\n 17/07/2022\nI did the fast, and when it was over I went back to listening to K-Pop, but I listen to it much less, and I don\u0026rsquo;t feel that NEED for it. I have also started going through all my K-Pop songs (ones in my Spotify library) and filtering them into three spotify playlists:\n yay-pop  songs that would make me go \u0026ldquo;yay\u0026rdquo; if Jesus walked into my room and asked me to put on some beats affirm biblical values add positive value with their meaning   may-pop  it\u0026rsquo;s generally neutral? a lot of love songs, of which there are many, but they don\u0026rsquo;t add much value. don\u0026rsquo;t outwardly contradict biblical values, but it\u0026rsquo;s not like they\u0026rsquo;re all that meaningful. somewhere for the in-betweens: I still like listening to nice sounds.   nay-pop  absolute no\u0026rsquo;s blatantly contradict biblical values and teachings on another note, could have other aspects to the artist or label that I dislike?  eg. I am NOT listening to LE SSERAFIM because the oversexualisation of Those young girls in particular is making me writhe in my seat. but they\u0026rsquo;re not going in the NAY playlist because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really listening to them in the first place      Giving up a 4 minute-long song is theoretically easy because God is so much more than whatever decibels I can fill my head with. But I\u0026rsquo;ve grown fond of a lot of songs that I am gonna be giving up. and that\u0026rsquo;s just Christian tings.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/kpop-caution/","summary":"I got into K-Pop quite a while ago, but since becoming more serious about my faith have often walked back from idolatry to just music enjoyment.

I would eventually like to add some basic key definitions and ideas here, but this is a quick-start guide to\u0026hellip;\nHow to shop more ethically: The Basics There are a few guidelines you can use to make better purchasing choices.\n1. Buy fewer clothes The first thing is just to buy fewer clothes. We all have lots of clothes, and probably don’t need to buy more, so reducing consumption and wearing the clothes you have til their bitter end is the best step. This has a positive environmental impact as well as it ensuring your money isn’t going to the wrong places.\n2. Buy secondhand If you need to buy clothes, try secondhand first. You are normally supporting a charity when you guy secondhand, and you can often find cooler pieces for way cheaper than they would retail.\n3. Buy new but ethical/sustainable If you have decided you need clothes and wish to buy them new, there are some websites that can help you figure out where they stand ethically.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know what\u0026rsquo;s actually sustainable?\u0026rdquo; Grading systems There are websites that grade brands:\n Goodonyou: https://goodonyou.eco/ is the main website with some good blogs, https://directory.goodonyou.eco/ is the actual brand ratings site. Baptist World Aid: https://baptistworldaid.org.au/resources/ethical-fashion-guide/ Fashion Revolution Transparency Index: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/  You should take the gradings with a grain of salt, and you can read up on how they grade brands if you want a better picture of what the ratings mean.\nOther websites and blogs (i.e. Google searches) There are websites that compile ethical brands in blog posts or lists, but it’s always a good idea to look on a brand\u0026rsquo;s website for how transparent their manufacturing process is, look up any articles or opinions about controversies (just googling or searching on Reddit for the brand name). Some websites include:\n Britt\u0026rsquo;s List: https://www.brittslist.com.au/, nice because it\u0026rsquo;s based in Aus Eco Warrior Princess: https://ecowarriorprincess.net/ Style Wise: https://stylewise-blog.com/  You can always google \u0026ldquo;ethical swimwear brands in Australia\u0026rdquo;, or replace this with other keywords, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find various google articles to comb through.\nThird-party certifications (Note: in response to my friend\u0026rsquo;s message about how there is lack of plus-size clothing at affordable prices)\nYeah for sure. I think you\u0026rsquo;d be interested in brands like HoMie or Afends, tho idk how well they do with larger sizes There are also various projects, movements or third-party certifications you can look for: Ethical Clothing Australia: https://ethicalclothingaustralia.org.au/ Who Made My Clothes/Fabric?: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/get-involved/ Certifications include B-Corp, GOTS and OEKO-TEX\nIn general, I find it enjoyable to research different brands and stuff. It’s just part of the natural process of my interest in fashion and also ethical or sustainable purchasing. So, if you enjoy the hunt, the process is quite easy. In fact, maybe I spend a little too much time looking into these things lol\nI wanna start a blog soon so I might make some more handy guides like this. (Note: see: this website)\nTip: Know what you like It also helps to know what style of clothes you like: colours, fabrics, styles, cuts, etc.. If you know your style, then you are more likely to buy clothes that you will wear for longer, and thus decrease the need for you to buy more clothes\nTip: Take care of the clothes you own Also, taking care of the clothes you have is important\nA few brands Afends Case study: Is Afends sustainable? (Note: in response to \u0026ldquo;Afends is sustainable??\u0026rdquo;)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s sustainable\nFor the most part\nTransparency about their supply chain is iffy, but sustainable is like part of being ethical\nAnd like, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to compromise a little to buy clothes you\u0026rsquo;ll actually wear, if you need them, if that makes sense\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no point buying clothes from the most ethical/sustainable brand if they’re not your style and you’re not going to wear them\nhttps://afends.com/pages/supply-chain\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0497/8277/files/Afends-ethical-sourcing-standards-web.pdf?v=1590563352\nBrand: Buon Clothing Buon Clothing is another cool brand, not sure how sustainable they are but their clothing is made in Melbourne\nhttps://www.buonclothing.com/pages/about\nAnd they have a really wide range of sizes\nHoMie HoMie clothing has a social enterprise aspect to their brand which is really cool, and they have info about their production process\nhttps://homie.com.au/pages/about\nTip: Mindset matters (Note: responding to my own message about how making compromises and buying clothes you will actually wear is more important than buying clothes you don\u0026rsquo;t like that tick all the boxes of being ethical/sustainable)\nI guess what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that it\u0026rsquo;s important to change your mindset about fashion more than it is to try and \u0026ldquo;buy better\u0026rdquo;, because your purchasing habits will come from your motives.\nIt is important to treat clothes as material goods with value and a lifespan. You should buy clothes with the intention of using them, loving them, and either passing them on to someone else before they\u0026rsquo;re dead if you don’t have a use for them, or using them until they’re falling apart at the seams (in which case, you can get your clothes repaired or tailored, and repeat the previous step until you can literally not wear them anymore)\n(Note: in response to my thankful friend who asked about this in the first place)\nGlad I could help :george:\nOn second-hand shopping: other ethical ramifications On the secondhand thing, you can also shop vintage if you have the means, or shop on websites like eBay, FB marketplace, depop, gumtree, etc., as some people are uncomfortable with buying from op shops when people who actually don’t have the means to spend more could’ve bought those op shop items\n(I personally don’t have an issue with op shopping, since most op shops are inundated with donations anyway, and a lot of op shop stock has to go to landfill if it doesn’t get sold)\nBrisbane vintage clothing stores I’ve been to include Arkive (Garden City, Chermside), SWOP (West End), Neo-Generalist (West End, in particular more expensive than other places). There are plenty of other vintage stores and op shops if you just search on Google or on Google Maps\n im still a “sustainable brand” hater honestly and think i can find everything i ever need on depop lol vintage clothing stores are always overpriced which is disappointing - my correct cousin\n Yeah this\nLike really, you can find literally anything you want on depop\nI don’t mind shopping vintage because 1. I get to try on clothes in person which means they’re 100% going to fit me and it’s not going to be a guessing game 2. Because if you buy something for $30 on depop and then you pay $10 shipping that\u0026rsquo;s pretty comparable to depop pricing anyway in some cases?\nI would not buy vintage on depop because most of it is overpriced AND you can’t try it on, which is sort of a lose-lose Don’t discount eBay. Here is a really good video about shopping on eBay. https://youtu.be/enl5LVszMRw. Since watching this video, I have bought a very cute top on eBay\nTo Be Honest, if I’m looking for stuff on depop, I’ll buy Uniqlo or Glassons for basics bc I like a lot of the basic cuts and styles from them and I can get my sizes from the brands by trying on their clothes in store. And I\u0026rsquo;m looking to buy some secondhand Rollas jeans too. Moral of this tidbit is if you have a fast fashion brand you like, you can probably pick it up from depop if sizing is an issue\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/ethical-fashion/","summary":"To be honest, this note was one of the main reasons I wanted to make a website: so I could easily link friends and family to resources about ethical fashion, without me necessarily dumping an entire essay into their DMs. This is just the compiled texts I sent to the main university Discord server I hang out in when the topic of fast fashion came up and people started asking, \u0026ldquo;How DO I stop shopping for fast fashion?","title":"Ethical fashion"},{"content":"I think you call this a stack, where you talk about applications you use and their setup.

For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (1 John 2:15–17, ESV)\n We have recently been having small groups discussions after church on Sunday evenings as part of our services. It has been wonderful to meet people around the church and engage with them in learning about God\u0026rsquo;s word and being. In our small group time, I got to talk with a couple of the older ladies and an older man from around the church. We were given a question stack similar to, \u0026ldquo;Do you have any favourite things/possessions? Is it okay to have nice things? If God asked you to get rid of them, would you do it?\u0026rdquo;.\nI expressed how I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling with taking care for the things I consume in relation to media (i.e., movies, TV shows, music, etc.). I have favourite movies or favourite music, but am unsure whether I would be able to give them up, and often wonder whether they are even helpful (see 1 Corinthians 6:12 and All things are lawful\u0026hellip;).\nOne lady talked about how must stuff is rubbish anyway, which I mostly agree with rationally, despite my heart being in opposition most of the time.\nAnother lady told me about a quote said by our senior pastor once. After looking it up, it was a quote by Corrie ten Boom. There are multiple iterations of this quote, as really Corrie Ten Boom believed in the idea but said it in many different phrasings during her life. The general idea, however, was:\n Hold all things loosely, because it will hurt if God must pry them out of your hands.\n- Corrie ten Boom\n Loss hurts. Change is hard. We like comfort and predictability, not things which are uncertain, new, or potentially dangerous. But God does not call us to live in the comfort of our possessions, our favourite albums, or spacious houses. God gives us things to build us up and enjoy, but will just as easily remove them from our grasp, for the sake of drawing near to him.\nI am planning on moving out soon, so the idea of letting things go has been on my mind. I want and I need to get rid of a lot of things before moving out. I am praying that God would help me loosen my grip, so that my loss will count as naught compared to the eternal treasures of heaven that God has in store.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/hold-loosely/","summary":"On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.\n Do not love the world or the things in the world.

I try the https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/putting-image-side-by-side/3926 solution but there might be something in my CSS that botches this up.  To customise CSS and HTML of a theme, you should override these rather than edit the themes files directly. The PaperMod files of my website were downloaded onto my laptop and edited directly, which I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done. For HTML, images, etc., you can create a new file in the folders of your actual site, rather than the theme\u0026rsquo;s folders. For example, to overwrite head.html stored in /my-site/themes/theme-name/layout/partials/ you can copy that file into something like /my-site/layouts/partials/ and then the content of that file will overwrite the original file. This is especially important if you have cloned a repository (but that\u0026rsquo;s kinda of obvious, right?).

I have tried to stick with Notion for many years now (with wavering success), dipped my toes into Obsidian, maintained a Studyblr back in the mid-to-late 2010s, and read or listened to people talk about second brains, Zettelkastens and atomising information (mostly, SuperMemo\u0026rsquo;s 20 rules of knowledge formation in the context of trying to use Anki, also only mildly successful given I found it difficult to implement in the study of tertiary-level mathematics).\nAfter reading Nikita\u0026rsquo;s writing on digital gardens, and then Maggie Appleton\u0026rsquo;s well-referenced article on their history and ethos, a digital garden seemed like the refreshing middle-ground I had been looking for in wanting to share learning with others in a orderly chaos without it being void of structure but also not strictly chronological. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t want to publish content on something like a blog that made me seem like an authority on anything because, realistically, I am incredibly imperfect and constantly learning. The digital garden acknowledges growth and encourages collaboration. It excites me.\nAnd, quite frankly, the concept of a digital garden also tickled my fancy because it feels rather cute and cottagecore-esque.\nHere, there will be learning, messing up, growing up, falling over, brushing off, getting back up, and doing all of that a thousand times.
