They should be densely linked to each other so that one can trawl through them similarly to how you would in a forest. I would like to get there eventually, but haven\u0026rsquo;t set up a good backlink system yet, so the archive is currently chronological as is the pagination from the home page.\nThis website will be a combination of a personal wiki and a digital garden. Some notes will be titled as things, some will be ideas and declarative statements, some will be abstract titles (I think I have been inspired by vlogbrothers in that regard), and some will be none of those things.

Think of it as pop psychology.\nTo participate in the Trauma Olympics is to partake in the competition of \u0026ldquo;who has experienced the worst trauma?\u0026rdquo;. What metrics are used? Quantity (how many events, for how long) and quality (how bad was it). This is not a great culture to participate in, but I have found myself falling victim to it from others and equally perpetuating it onto others.\nWhen talking about traumatic experiences in life, if others around you have experienced seemingly worse things than you, you can either feel within yourself a minimisation of your own experiences, or be explicitly told, \u0026ldquo;your experiences are not as bad as mine have been\u0026rdquo;. A negative consequence of this is the feeling that one is not allowed to feel as poorly as they do about what they have been through because of its relative okay-ness to those around them.\nIf you sense you have had worse experiences than others, as I often do, you may possibly minimise your own experiences to give others space to share their lesser experiences, or you may tout your own trauma so as to feel better about the sorry state of your life. I do both of these, much to my chagrin.\nReally, I think the solution to the many pitfalls is to be empathetic to one another. If someone is going through something traumatic, or is healing from past trauma, simply be there for the person. Listen, clarify, ask questions, refer them to professionals who can help, check in with them.\nHere is a list of things I avoid saying or doing when someone are sharing emotions, experiences or trauma with me, from my own personal experience of feeling minimised or unsafe in a conversation, as well as what I\u0026rsquo;ve found seems to work:\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone has experienced hardship and goes through tough times.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Look on the bright side: what didn\u0026rsquo;t kill you made you stronger.\u0026rdquo; Talking about how you relate to someone\u0026rsquo;s hardship can sometimes be unhelpful, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t actually experienced similar situations to them, but this varies and depends a lot on the people talking.  For example, for a person talking about their experience with trauma from sexual assault, if the person they are sharing with responds with \u0026ldquo;I can relate, because I have felt pain and trauma during break-ups\u0026rdquo;, that may not be helpful, as those two experiences objectively differ a lot. Not to say one pain is worse than the other (we are trying to avoid that) but there are objective differences between those situations that make the \u0026ldquo;I relate to you\u0026rdquo; sentiment feel ingenuine or misplaced.   \u0026ldquo;But you seem fine, so are your difficulties really that bad, or are you just playing them up?\u0026rdquo;  Everyone feels their experiences differently. The way I feel, experience and deal with past trauma and ongoing traumatic events is totally different to the way my friends would, because everyone has an individual experience of the world and different capacities for dealing with problems. The Trauma Olympics are not helpful, useful, or loving. Let\u0026rsquo;s see each other as individual people and get to know others and their experiences, in love and care for one another, and not in competition against each other.\n Further reading\nWelcome to the Trauma Olympics by Anne Davis\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/trauma-olympics/","summary":"Disclaimer: totally based on personal experience, and not properly researched.

I would eventually like to add some basic key definitions and ideas here, but this is a quick-start guide to\u0026hellip;\nHow to shop more ethically: The Basics There are a few guidelines you can use to make better purchasing choices.\n1. Buy fewer clothes The first thing is just to buy fewer clothes. We all have lots of clothes, and probably don’t need to buy more, so reducing consumption and wearing the clothes you have til their bitter end is the best step. This has a positive environmental impact as well as it ensuring your money isn’t going to the wrong places.\n2. Buy secondhand If you need to buy clothes, try secondhand first. You are normally supporting a charity when you guy secondhand, and you can often find cooler pieces for way cheaper than they would retail.\n3. Buy new but ethical/sustainable If you have decided you need clothes and wish to buy them new, there are some websites that can help you figure out where they stand ethically.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know what\u0026rsquo;s actually sustainable?\u0026rdquo; Grading systems There are websites that grade brands:\n Goodonyou: https://goodonyou.eco/ is the main website with some good blogs, https://directory.goodonyou.eco/ is the actual brand ratings site. Baptist World Aid: https://baptistworldaid.org.au/resources/ethical-fashion-guide/ Fashion Revolution Transparency Index: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/  You should take the gradings with a grain of salt, and you can read up on how they grade brands if you want a better picture of what the ratings mean.\nOther websites and blogs (i.e. Google searches) There are websites that compile ethical brands in blog posts or lists, but it’s always a good idea to look on a brand\u0026rsquo;s website for how transparent their manufacturing process is, look up any articles or opinions about controversies (just googling or searching on Reddit for the brand name). Some websites include:\n Britt\u0026rsquo;s List: https://www.brittslist.com.au/, nice because it\u0026rsquo;s based in Aus Eco Warrior Princess: https://ecowarriorprincess.net/  You can always google \u0026ldquo;ethical swimwear brands in Australia\u0026rdquo;, or replace this with other keywords, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find various google articles to comb through.\nThird-party certifications (Note: in response to my friend\u0026rsquo;s message about how there is lack of plus-size clothing at affordable prices)\nYeah for sure. I think you\u0026rsquo;d be interested in brands like HoMie or Afends, tho idk how well they do with larger sizes There are also various projects, movements or third-party certifications you can look for: Ethical Clothing Australia: https://ethicalclothingaustralia.org.au/ Who Made My Clothes/Fabric?: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/get-involved/ Certifications include B-Corp, GOTS and OEKO-TEX\nIn general, I find it enjoyable to research different brands and stuff. It’s just part of the natural process of my interest in fashion and also ethical or sustainable purchasing. So, if you enjoy the hunt, the process is quite easy. In fact, maybe I spend a little too much time looking into these things lol\nI wanna start a blog soon so I might make some more handy guides like this. (Note: see: this website)\nTip: Know what you like It also helps to know what style of clothes you like: colours, fabrics, styles, cuts, etc.. If you know your style, then you are more likely to buy clothes that you will wear for longer, and thus decrease the need for you to buy more clothes\nTip: Take care of the clothes you own Also, taking care of the clothes you have is important\nA few brands Afends Case study: Is Afends sustainable? (Note: in response to \u0026ldquo;Afends is sustainable??\u0026rdquo;)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s sustainable\nFor the most part\nTransparency about their supply chain is iffy, but sustainable is like part of being ethical\nAnd like, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to compromise a little to buy clothes you\u0026rsquo;ll actually wear, if you need them, if that makes sense\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no point buying clothes from the most ethical/sustainable brand if they’re not your style and you’re not going to wear them\nhttps://afends.com/pages/supply-chain\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0497/8277/files/Afends-ethical-sourcing-standards-web.pdf?v=1590563352\nBrand: Buon Clothing Buon Clothing is another cool brand, not sure how sustainable they are but their clothing is made in Melbourne\nhttps://www.buonclothing.com/pages/about\nAnd they have a really wide range of sizes\nHoMie HoMie clothing has a social enterprise aspect to their brand which is really cool, and they have info about their production process\nhttps://homie.com.au/pages/about\nTip: Mindset matters (Note: responding to my own message about how making compromises and buying clothes you will actually wear is more important than buying clothes you don\u0026rsquo;t like that tick all the boxes of being ethical/sustainable)\nI guess what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that it\u0026rsquo;s important to change your mindset about fashion more than it is to try and \u0026ldquo;buy better\u0026rdquo;, because your purchasing habits will come from your motives.\nIt is important to treat clothes as material goods with value and a lifespan. You should buy clothes with the intention of using them, loving them, and either passing them on to someone else before they\u0026rsquo;re dead if you don’t have a use for them, or using them until they’re falling apart at the seams (in which case, you can get your clothes repaired or tailored, and repeat the previous step until you can literally not wear them anymore)\n(Note: in response to my thankful friend who asked about this in the first place)\nGlad I could help :george:\nOn second-hand shopping: other ethical ramifications On the secondhand thing, you can also shop vintage if you have the means, or shop on websites like eBay, FB marketplace, depop, gumtree, etc., as some people are uncomfortable with buying from op shops when people who actually don’t have the means to spend more could’ve bought those op shop items\n(I personally don’t have an issue with op shopping, since most op shops are inundated with donations anyway, and a lot of op shop stock has to go to landfill if it doesn’t get sold)\nBrisbane vintage clothing stores I’ve been to include Arkive (Garden City, Chermside), SWOP (West End), Neo-Generalist (West End, in particular more expensive than other places). There are plenty of other vintage stores and op shops if you just search on Google or on Google Maps\n im still a “sustainable brand” hater honestly and think i can find everything i ever need on depop lol vintage clothing stores are always overpriced which is disappointing - my correct cousin\n Yeah this\nLike really, you can find literally anything you want on depop\nI don’t mind shopping vintage because 1. I get to try on clothes in person which means they’re 100% going to fit me and it’s not going to be a guessing game 2. Because if you buy something for $30 on depop and then you pay $10 shipping that\u0026rsquo;s pretty comparable to depop pricing anyway in some cases?\nI would not buy vintage on depop because most of it is overpriced AND you can’t try it on, which is sort of a lose-lose Don’t discount eBay. Here is a really good video about shopping on eBay. https://youtu.be/enl5LVszMRw. Since watching this video, I have bought a very cute top on eBay\nTo Be Honest, if I’m looking for stuff on depop, I’ll buy Uniqlo or Glassons for basics bc I like a lot of the basic cuts and styles from them and I can get my sizes from the brands by trying on their clothes in store. And I\u0026rsquo;m looking to buy some secondhand Rollas jeans too. Moral of this tidbit is if you have a fast fashion brand you like, you can probably pick it up from depop if sizing is an issue\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/ethical-fashion/","summary":"To be honest, this note was one of the main reasons I wanted to make a website: so I could easily link friends and family to resources about ethical fashion, without me necessarily dumping an entire essay into their DMs. This is just the compiled texts I sent to the main university Discord server I hang out in when the topic of fast fashion came up and people started asking, \u0026ldquo;How DO I stop shopping for fast fashion?","title":"Ethical fashion"},{"content":"I think you call this a stack, where you talk about applications you use and their setup.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (1 John 2:15–17, ESV)\n We have recently been having small groups discussions after church on Sunday evenings as part of our services. It has been wonderful to meet people around the church and engage with them in learning about God\u0026rsquo;s word and being. In our small group time, I got to talk with a couple of the older ladies and an older man from around the church. We were given a question stack similar to, \u0026ldquo;Do you have any favourite things/possessions? Is it okay to have nice things? If God asked you to get rid of them, would you do it?\u0026rdquo;.\nI expressed how I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling with taking care for the things I consume in relation to media (i.e., movies, TV shows, music, etc.). I have favourite movies or favourite music, but am unsure whether I would be able to give them up, and often wonder whether they are even helpful (see 1 Corinthians 6:12 and All things are lawful\u0026hellip;).\nOne lady talked about how must stuff is rubbish anyway, which I mostly agree with rationally, despite my heart being in opposition most of the time.\nAnother lady told me about a quote said by our senior pastor once. After looking it up, it was a quote by Corrie ten Boom. There are multiple iterations of this quote, as really Corrie Ten Boom believed in the idea but said it in many different phrasings during her life. The general idea, however, was:\n Hold all things loosely, because it will hurt if God must pry them out of your hands.\n- Corrie ten Boom\n Loss hurts. Change is hard. We like comfort and predictability, not things which are uncertain, new, or potentially dangerous. But God does not call us to live in the comfort of our possessions, our favourite albums, or spacious houses. God gives us things to build us up and enjoy, but will just as easily remove them from our grasp, for the sake of drawing near to him.\nI am planning on moving out soon, so the idea of letting things go has been on my mind. I want and I need to get rid of a lot of things before moving out. I am praying that God would help me loosen my grip, so that my loss will count as naught compared to the eternal treasures of heaven that God has in store.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/hold-loosely/","summary":"On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.\n Do not love the world or the things in the world.

The PaperMod files of my website were downloaded onto my laptop and edited directly, which I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done. For HTML, images, etc., you can create a new file in the folders of your actual site, rather than the theme\u0026rsquo;s folders. For example, to overwrite head.html stored in /my-site/themes/theme-name/layout/partials/ you can copy that file into something like /my-site/layouts/partials/ and then the content of that file will overwrite the original file. This is especially important if you have cloned a repository (but that\u0026rsquo;s kinda of obvious, right?).

A blog seemed limiting, and I got caught up in a lot of websites recommending I choose a niche and stick to it.\nI did already know how I would want to run this website, thanks to my friend Tom who suggested I run my site with Hugo off of Github.\nWhilst combing through the Hugo themes on offer, I stumbled across a page about Hugo on Nikita Voloboev\u0026rsquo;s old personal wiki, and then discovered her new wiki and the idea of a Digital Garden.\nI had read about all kinds of personal knowledge management systems (PKMs) and related software before. I have tried to stick with Notion for many years now (with wavering success), dipped my toes into Obsidian, maintained a Studyblr back in the mid-to-late 2010s, and read or listened to people talk about second brains, Zettelkastens and atomising information (mostly, SuperMemo\u0026rsquo;s 20 rules of knowledge formation in the context of trying to use Anki, also only mildly successful given I found it difficult to implement in the study of tertiary-level mathematics).\nAfter reading Nikita\u0026rsquo;s writing on digital gardens, and then Maggie Appleton\u0026rsquo;s well-referenced article on their history and ethos, a digital garden seemed like the refreshing middle-ground I had been looking for in wanting to share learning with others in a orderly chaos without it being void of structure but also not strictly chronological. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t want to publish content on something like a blog that made me seem like an authority on anything because, realistically, I am incredibly imperfect and constantly learning. The digital garden acknowledges growth and encourages collaboration. It excites me.\nAnd, quite frankly, the concept of a digital garden also tickled my fancy because it feels rather cute and cottagecore-esque.\nHere, there will be learning, messing up, growing up, falling over, brushing off, getting back up, and doing all of that a thousand times.
