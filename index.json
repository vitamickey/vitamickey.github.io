Just have to use pink colouring roll into balls and fill with Do SAR (red bean sweet paste from a tin) or.

Ingredients are 1 packet rice flour - the one with green writing - two thirds cup caster sugar 2 cups hot water and pink colour\nDissolve sugar in water Add colour first then add to flour. Keep 1 and half tablespoons flour reserved to work the dough as you roll and fill. Add colouring carefully as too much would be too bright\nJin doys are rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried turning and pressing until pale golden colour Have to be very careful with young child around. Needs 2 bottles peanut oil. Then after have to strain oil into bottles when cool and use for normal stir fry. I picked up Ella from second day school today and she has just fallen asleep after reading Enid Blyton to her. Nicole picking Luca up from kindy and should be home soon. Goong he fut Choy. For tomorrow. Xxx\n1 Feb notes:\noil needs to be SUPER low move the balls constantly - burns on bottom of pot from the cookbook “Mum used to take a ball of dough about 4cm, then with her thumb, make a hole, continuing until she had a bag shape and the dough thinnish. Fill the hole with a small amount of Do Sar (red bean paste) then bring edges together and press bottom to seal. Its important that the seal isnt too bulky/thick, or it wall be a blob of uncooked dough after youve fried. We didnt have sesame seeds in the old days)\nI couldnt make that shape. so I just flatten a small amount of dough into a circle and gradually thin out the edges, then in a saucer with sesame seeds, flatten and press the centre of that dough into the seeds. at the same time making the dough thinner. Put some filling into the centre of the circle and pleat the circle so that you can close the gap! First one done!!\nWhen I started making them, I always made small balls of just dough to test the temperature of the oil and the children used to love those best. as they werent used to the taste of the red bean\nPut prepared balls on large plate and cover with tea towel or wrap and when finished, heat oil to medium temp.\nYou will find that the balls of dough sink to the bottom so use chopsticks or your tool to move them or it will anchor to the bottom and burn. One has to keep balls moving as they cook so all sides get brown.\nWhen light brown take out and its a good idea to have a large sieve that can balance on the edge of the saucepan so it can drain oil - then put on cooking paper to cool. It takes just over two and a quarter hours to finish the jin doys. Yum Yum.\nWhen the oil has cooled, it has to be strained so use the sieve and one layer of kleenex tissue over sieve, and strain into another saucepan so bits of sesame and residue are left behind.\nI have a funnel that can be used (with care) and have wide mouth bottles that I put into the empty sink and make sure they dont tip over, then put sieve on top of the funnel and transfer the oil from the saucepan directly. \u0026quot; - Michaela\u0026rsquo;s great aunt Elsa\n1 packet rice flour - the one with green writing 2/3 cup caster sugar 2 cups hot water METHOD:\nDissolve sugar in water.

Then after, have to strain oil into bottles when cool and use for normal stir fry.\nTo make char gor (cha guo), add pink food colouring to the water before mixing the water into the flour, and steam for 12 min.\nTip: Add colouring carefully as too much would be too bright\nThere is also a Vietnamese sort of thing https://www.hungryhuy.com/banh-cam-banh-ran-recipe-vietnamese-fried-sesame-balls/\n","permalink":"https://michaelacheong.com/jin-doy-jian-dui-sesame-balls-red-bean/","summary":"Related:\nRecipes tried in 2022 Rice flour (green writing) Red bean paste Toasted sesame seeds Sesame oil https://cookingwithdog.com/recipe/sesame-balls-goma-dango/ Oh!

But before we conclude, let’s do some exercises to make sure everything has been well understood. How would you type ớ? Yes, it’s: ơ + the acute accent, so that the Telex typing sequence is “ows”.\nNow, how about the word đặng? If your answer is “ddawjng” for Telex, you’ve got it! The only note here is that instead of typing the dot right after the ă (i.e, “awj” for Telex), you can delay the dot till completing the whole word, which means your typing sequence could have been “ddawngj” for Telex. In fact many Vietnamese use this second way of typing the accent mark after completing the alphabet.\nNow, if you have asked if it’s possible to defer the “breve” on top of the a till finishing the whole word, which means typing “ddajngw” instead of “ddawjng”, the answer is yes. It’s possible because the typing software, which understands our conventions, would easily figure out that your “w” is to change the a to ă. However, this type of deferral is not used by many people and is also not recommended for the reason that it may actually slow you down. Indeed, when you finish the world, you probably need to “look back” at the word and see what kind of “symbol” you need to add to the vowels. In addition, since ă, for example, is part of the Vietnamese Alphabet, it makes sense that we type it as one single unit.\nhttps://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/type-vietnamese/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://michaelacheong.com/how-to-type-vietnamese-using-telex/","summary":"Key Letters1 Letter group â, ê, ô, đ ư, ơ and ă Telex letter + letter letter + w Example aa aw Output â ă The 5 diacritics1 Diacritics acute ´ grave ` hook ̉ tilde ~ dot .

I was going to say I am not entirely sure \u0026ldquo;teach\u0026rdquo; here refers to specifically spiritual teaching, but perusing the interlinear Bible it seems that this verb gets brought up in the context of spiritual teaching only.2\nBut also, I am still pretty convinced that this passage gets brought up in the context of addressing disruption by the women in the church proceedings of Ephesus, i.e. addressing a direct problem in this congregation (contradiction1). And so, if this is addressing this church directly, it makes sense for us to step out of the direct wording of this passage and see the message could have been, \u0026ldquo;oh, this church\u0026rsquo;s women were being Particularly disruptive, let\u0026rsquo;s try and address these issues.\u0026rdquo;\nEspecially since the verses above it discuss adorning oneself in expensive clothing.

Personal style imo is a mix of:\nKnowing what works That is, using systems with a basis in some kind of theory.\nColour theory Seasonal colour analysis Enter: seasonal colour analysis. Uses the colour of YOU to figure out what colours theoretically complement you best. I am a dark autumn because I have:\n\u0026ldquo;warm\u0026rdquo; skin? (see below) I like gold-toned jewellery more than silver. med-high contrast black hair, v dark brown but basically black eyes, against lighter skin medium chroma I am not very saturated, but I am not totally desaturated in colouring. Very popular to do colour analysis in SK but actual colour analysis sessions are SO EXPENSIVE yoinks\nLinks:\nhttps://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/dark-autumn-a-comprehensive-guide General comments on colour theory SKINTONE and UNDERTONE what even is this there is not really a consensus on how to categorise skintone and undertone?? I would say I have a yellow skintone with an olive undertone. I am yellow, I am green. And this makes me warm overall?? but my undertone is cool. So, idk. I DON\u0026rsquo;T THINK OLIVE IS A SKINTONE?????????\ntechnically for seasonal colour analysis you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to consider your skin UNDERTONE but I like to consider the overall impression of my skin\u0026rsquo;s colour. I think bc I have olive undertones, I like to lean towards navy a LOT as a neutral in my wardrobe bc it works for me.\nHow this influences my clothing choices My general wardrobe colour palette:\nFrom Pinterest\nHOWEVER COMMA my main colours are\nblack (I don\u0026rsquo;t like vintage black so much, should be a pure black) navy (warmer, greener undertones, rather than purple or ultramarine) brown (all variations, but warmer undertones are better) beige red (deeper, medium saturation) greens (either light olive/lime or mostly dark greens) yellow (a deep-ish mustard-ish but not typical mustard?? idk) pink (deeper) I want more\npurple! (deeper purples) and I avoid\nburnt orange (don\u0026rsquo;t ask me why, I just don\u0026rsquo;t like it even though it\u0026rsquo;s technically in my colour palette) light blues (except for my light wash jeans which tbh I might get rid of soon) bright anything colours that are too desaturated grey (unless it\u0026rsquo;s warm like cozy elephant vibes) tan?? (it\u0026rsquo;s too close to my skintone makes me unfomy sometimes) Body type Kibbe body types I\u0026rsquo;ve read a lot of Cozy Rebekah\u0026rsquo;s blog posts about this lol. I think I\u0026rsquo;m soft classic?? but people notoriously categorise themselves as this when they\u0026rsquo;re actually a theatrical romantic, or soft gamine. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know, and it\u0026rsquo;s been years. Anyway, pretty controversial method of body typing. Has pros and cons.\nDressing for your \u0026ldquo;body shape\u0026rdquo;?? Like, if you\u0026rsquo;re a \u0026ldquo;pear\u0026rdquo;, then you need to wear things that appear to make your shoulders broader and your hips or thighs slimmer.\nGeneral comments on body type I like the Kibbe idea of complementing your features rather than \u0026ldquo;negating\u0026rdquo; them like in a typical \u0026ldquo;dress for your shape\u0026rdquo; guide. In a typical \u0026ldquo;dress for you shape\u0026rdquo; situation, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to negate things to achieve the ideal \u0026ldquo;hourglass\u0026rdquo; figure. But Kibbe says, EMBRACE THE AESTHETIC.\nPast experience I know I like certain cuts of clothing, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like others\nClothing aspects I like high waists wide legs collars crew necks long shorts Clothing aspects I avoid Silver hardware Rose gold hardware (I could write an essay about my dislike for rose gold) asymmetry? eg. wrap dresses thick waistbands on clothing eg. pants with two buttons on the waistband, just, any thick waistband. sleeves: too short (I don\u0026rsquo;t shave so this can cause issues) raglan necklines: boat scoop turtleneck mock neck exposing my waist or too much thigh linen :sob: Knowing what you want Generally, figure out what you want your style to be I guess?? Like, I want my style to be a certain way.\ncomfy easy poppin Style priorities Suggested by Body and Style. Video: How to Stop Buying Trends + Find Your Style | from a stylist. Pinterest board: Style Priorities, Collection by Body \u0026amp; Style\nstyle priority = message you want to send to the world with your clothes, i.e. how you want to come across Choose 4 priorities you can break down these too Dissect that style write all elements, regardless of your personal preference for them eg. edgy = chains, leather, metal, lace, black, etc. Combine elements to find your perfect clothes combine details from across the list Take body type and colour season into account? eg. romantic body type should take into account romantic elements. Don\u0026rsquo;t create a mishmash of different elements: create harmony. Doing the method Priorities Academic Retro/60s/70s Elegant/clean/minimal (Currently very) Sporty (Mayyybe) Girl next door/cosy/cute/comfy Aesthetics uwu Just using pinterest and seeing what sticks LOL. Brings me back to tumblr. Are you a bruh girl or a hi girl?? Also see Cozy Rebekah\ndark academia Parisian fairycore cottagecore? Essences Dramatic Natural Gamine Classic Romantic Ingenue (technically scrubbed by Kibbe) Angelic/ethereal I am not dramatic or natural. I think I am ingenue? Classic? Romantic?\nTRends? It\u0026rsquo;s fun to try trends (normally can be found in op shops) and to see what you actually like long-term or if it\u0026rsquo;s just a fad. Eg. I was into layering camis over shirts, and that has found mild longevity in my wardrobe, but I probably won\u0026rsquo;t buy more camis for this purpose, since I don\u0026rsquo;t really like wearing them alone.\nKnowing what you actually wear I recently thought about it, and the stuff I reach for on a daily basis is just comfy stuff. Big zip-up jumpers, with a pair of high-waisted, typically wide-legged pants or jeans, with a t-shirt.\nMy uniform Advice from https://youtu.be/yxz4FCSDjIs is to find a \u0026ldquo;uniform\u0026rdquo;, i.e. a go-to outfit you wear often. Like, if you were a cartoon character, what would you wear?\nTypically: pants, t-shirt tucked into pants, jacket (even in summer bc aircon gets cold), with converse or my mary jane docs.\nBalancing act So, I guess there are three aspects:\nWhat works, your theoretical style What you want, your dream style What you wear, your current style And your personal style falls somewhere in the middle of these three things.\nIn the end, WEAR WHATEVER U WANT.\nAnother style theory: Style Roots A style theory by Body and Style (by Ellie Jean) discovered by me on 2022-07-13.

At the start of this year (2022), I watched Crash Course Linguistics, hosted by Taylor Behnke, to get a taste of linguistics before my uni semester started. This year, I took my first linguistics course at uni, which I just barely missed the intake for last year. When the 2022 P4A rolled around, I tuned in, and it just so happened that Taylor Behnke was hosting a few hours of the stream. The event also closely coincided with me starting my linguistics course. So, what better way to spend my money than to support a charity event that excites me than buying a piece of art which also commemorates a turning point in my linguistics journey?\nFruit stickers Collection of fruit stickers by Kelly Angood, via Bon Appetit.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t remember why it came up, but I remembered that fruit labels are cool.

I like pretty things. So, notion has a hold on me. I generally will use it for planning that requires a pretty modular approach, that I would like to be able to access in the long-term, that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to plan just in a Google doc or with an analogue method like in my bullet journal or just on a plain ol\u0026rsquo; piece of paper OH another thing Notion is really good for is team collaboration. For sure. Like being able to have these really dynamic layouts for team workflows I’ve seen use cases where it works very nicely, but of course there are other programs that could achieve that too I tried Obsidian but it was hard to move over and I missed being able to make it pretty I have dipped my toes into Evernote but I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of storing everything on Evernote not that I use Notion to store everything\u0026hellip; Ways I am trying to walk away/my alternative planning and note-taking systems I actually want to port a lot of the stuff from my notion into markdown and onto my website?

Bought on a whim from CW, and it’s the perfect subtle but hydrating colour for everyday. Can literally wear in any situation. Pat McGrath Mattrance? In Flesh 3. It’s super nice, but not CF. Bought secondhand off Reddit. Yes:\nColourpop: Cutie Fruity Cherry Pickin Lay over is a smidge pink for me but still works Rituelle de Fille: Written in Blood. It\u0026rsquo;s a really nice product and the bold blue-based red actually kinda worked for me. Didn’t lean orange, which is something I look for in a bolder red lipstick.

Quantity (how many events, for how long) and quality (how bad was it). This is not a great culture to participate in, but I have found myself falling victim to it from others and equally perpetuating it onto others.\nWhen talking about traumatic experiences in life, if others around you have experienced seemingly worse things than you, you can either feel within yourself a minimisation of your own experiences, or be explicitly told, \u0026ldquo;your experiences are not as bad as mine have been\u0026rdquo;. A negative consequence of this is the feeling that one is not allowed to feel as poorly as they do about what they have been through because of its relative okay-ness to those around them.\nIf you sense you have had worse experiences than others, as I often do, you may possibly minimise your own experiences to give others space to share their lesser experiences, or you may tout your own trauma so as to feel better about the sorry state of your life. I do both of these, much to my chagrin.\nReally, I think the solution to the many pitfalls is to be empathetic to one another. If someone is going through something traumatic, or is healing from past trauma, simply be there for the person. Listen, clarify, ask questions, refer them to professionals who can help, check in with them.\nHere is a list of things I avoid saying or doing when someone are sharing emotions, experiences or trauma with me, from my own personal experience of feeling minimised or unsafe in a conversation, as well as what I\u0026rsquo;ve found seems to work:\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone has experienced hardship and goes through tough times.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Look on the bright side: what didn\u0026rsquo;t kill you made you stronger.\u0026rdquo; Talking about how you relate to someone\u0026rsquo;s hardship can sometimes be unhelpful, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t actually experienced similar situations to them, but this varies and depends a lot on the people talking. For example, for a person talking about their experience with trauma from sexual assault, if the person they are sharing with responds with \u0026ldquo;I can relate, because I have felt pain and trauma during break-ups\u0026rdquo;, that may not be helpful, as those two experiences objectively differ a lot. Not to say one pain is worse than the other (we are trying to avoid that) but there are objective differences between those situations that make the \u0026ldquo;I relate to you\u0026rdquo; sentiment feel ingenuine or misplaced. \u0026ldquo;But you seem fine, so are your difficulties really that bad, or are you just playing them up?\u0026rdquo; Everyone feels their experiences differently. The way I feel, experience and deal with past trauma and ongoing traumatic events is totally different to the way my friends would, because everyone has an individual experience of the world and different capacities for dealing with problems. The Trauma Olympics are not helpful, useful, or loving. Let\u0026rsquo;s see each other as individual people and get to know others and their experiences, in love and care for one another, and not in competition against each other.\nFurther reading\nWelcome to the Trauma Olympics by Anne Davis\n","permalink":"https://michaelacheong.com/trauma-olympics/","summary":"Disclaimer: totally based on personal experience, and not properly researched.

I would eventually like to add some basic key definitions and ideas here, but this is a quick-start guide to\u0026hellip;\nHow to shop more ethically: The Basics There are a few guidelines you can use to make better purchasing choices.\n1. Buy fewer clothes The first thing is just to buy fewer clothes. We all have lots of clothes, and probably don’t need to buy more, so reducing consumption and wearing the clothes you have til their bitter end is the best step. This has a positive environmental impact as well as it ensuring your money isn’t going to the wrong places.\n2. Buy secondhand If you need to buy clothes, try secondhand first. You are normally supporting a charity when you guy secondhand, and you can often find cooler pieces for way cheaper than they would retail.\n3. Buy new but ethical/sustainable If you have decided you need clothes and wish to buy them new, there are some websites that can help you figure out where they stand ethically.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know what\u0026rsquo;s actually sustainable?\u0026rdquo; Grading systems There are websites that grade brands:\nGoodonyou: https://goodonyou.eco/ is the main website with some good blogs, https://directory.goodonyou.eco/ is the actual brand ratings site. Baptist World Aid: https://baptistworldaid.org.au/resources/ethical-fashion-guide/ Fashion Revolution Transparency Index: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/ You should take the gradings with a grain of salt, and you can read up on how they grade brands if you want a better picture of what the ratings mean.\nOther websites and blogs (i.e. Google searches) There are websites that compile ethical brands in blog posts or lists, but it’s always a good idea to look on a brand\u0026rsquo;s website for how transparent their manufacturing process is, look up any articles or opinions about controversies (just googling or searching on Reddit for the brand name). Some websites include:\nBritt\u0026rsquo;s List: https://www.brittslist.com.au/, nice because it\u0026rsquo;s based in Aus Eco Warrior Princess: https://ecowarriorprincess.net/ Style Wise: https://stylewise-blog.com/ You can always google \u0026ldquo;ethical swimwear brands in Australia\u0026rdquo;, or replace this with other keywords, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find various google articles to comb through.\nThird-party certifications (Note: in response to my friend\u0026rsquo;s message about how there is lack of plus-size clothing at affordable prices)\nYeah for sure. I think you\u0026rsquo;d be interested in brands like HoMie or Afends, tho idk how well they do with larger sizes There are also various projects, movements or third-party certifications you can look for: Ethical Clothing Australia: https://ethicalclothingaustralia.org.au/ Who Made My Clothes/Fabric?: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/get-involved/ Certifications include B-Corp, GOTS and OEKO-TEX\nIn general, I find it enjoyable to research different brands and stuff. It’s just part of the natural process of my interest in fashion and also ethical or sustainable purchasing. So, if you enjoy the hunt, the process is quite easy. In fact, maybe I spend a little too much time looking into these things lol\nI wanna start a blog soon so I might make some more handy guides like this. (Note: see: this website)\nTip: Know what you like It also helps to know what style of clothes you like: colours, fabrics, styles, cuts, etc.. If you know your style, then you are more likely to buy clothes that you will wear for longer, and thus decrease the need for you to buy more clothes\nTip: Take care of the clothes you own Also, taking care of the clothes you have is important\nA few brands Afends Case study: Is Afends sustainable? (Note: in response to \u0026ldquo;Afends is sustainable??\u0026rdquo;)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s sustainable\nFor the most part\nTransparency about their supply chain is iffy, but sustainable is like part of being ethical\nAnd like, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to compromise a little to buy clothes you\u0026rsquo;ll actually wear, if you need them, if that makes sense\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no point buying clothes from the most ethical/sustainable brand if they’re not your style and you’re not going to wear them\nhttps://afends.com/pages/supply-chain\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0497/8277/files/Afends-ethical-sourcing-standards-web.pdf?v=1590563352\nBrand: Buon Clothing Buon Clothing is another cool brand, not sure how sustainable they are but their clothing is made in Melbourne\nhttps://www.buonclothing.com/pages/about\nAnd they have a really wide range of sizes\nHoMie HoMie clothing has a social enterprise aspect to their brand which is really cool, and they have info about their production process\nhttps://homie.com.au/pages/about\nTip: Mindset matters (Note: responding to my own message about how making compromises and buying clothes you will actually wear is more important than buying clothes you don\u0026rsquo;t like that tick all the boxes of being ethical/sustainable)\nI guess what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that it\u0026rsquo;s important to change your mindset about fashion more than it is to try and \u0026ldquo;buy better\u0026rdquo;, because your purchasing habits will come from your motives.\nIt is important to treat clothes as material goods with value and a lifespan. You should buy clothes with the intention of using them, loving them, and either passing them on to someone else before they\u0026rsquo;re dead if you don’t have a use for them, or using them until they’re falling apart at the seams (in which case, you can get your clothes repaired or tailored, and repeat the previous step until you can literally not wear them anymore)\n(Note: in response to my thankful friend who asked about this in the first place)\nGlad I could help :george:\nOn second-hand shopping: other ethical ramifications On the secondhand thing, you can also shop vintage if you have the means, or shop on websites like eBay, FB marketplace, depop, gumtree, etc., as some people are uncomfortable with buying from op shops when people who actually don’t have the means to spend more could’ve bought those op shop items\n(I personally don’t have an issue with op shopping, since most op shops are inundated with donations anyway, and a lot of op shop stock has to go to landfill if it doesn’t get sold)\nBrisbane vintage clothing stores I’ve been to include Arkive (Garden City, Chermside), SWOP (West End), Neo-Generalist (West End, in particular more expensive than other places). There are plenty of other vintage stores and op shops if you just search on Google or on Google Maps\nim still a “sustainable brand” hater honestly and think i can find everything i ever need on depop lol vintage clothing stores are always overpriced which is disappointing - my correct cousin\nYeah this\nLike really, you can find literally anything you want on depop\nI don’t mind shopping vintage because 1. I get to try on clothes in person which means they’re 100% going to fit me and it’s not going to be a guessing game 2. Because if you buy something for $30 on depop and then you pay $10 shipping that\u0026rsquo;s pretty comparable to depop pricing anyway in some cases?\nI would not buy vintage on depop because most of it is overpriced AND you can’t try it on, which is sort of a lose-lose Don’t discount eBay. Here is a really good video about shopping on eBay. https://youtu.be/enl5LVszMRw. Since watching this video, I have bought a very cute top on eBay\nTo Be Honest, if I’m looking for stuff on depop, I’ll buy Uniqlo or Glassons for basics bc I like a lot of the basic cuts and styles from them and I can get my sizes from the brands by trying on their clothes in store.

For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (1 John 2:15–17, ESV)\nWe have recently been having small groups discussions after church on Sunday evenings as part of our services. It has been wonderful to meet people around the church and engage with them in learning about God\u0026rsquo;s word and being. In our small group time, I got to talk with a couple of the older ladies and an older man from around the church. We were given a question stack similar to, \u0026ldquo;Do you have any favourite things/possessions? Is it okay to have nice things? If God asked you to get rid of them, would you do it?\u0026rdquo;.\nI expressed how I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling with taking care for the things I consume in relation to media (i.e., movies, TV shows, music, etc.). I have favourite movies or favourite music, but am unsure whether I would be able to give them up, and often wonder whether they are even helpful (see 1 Corinthians 6:12 and All things are lawful\u0026hellip;).\nOne lady talked about how must stuff is rubbish anyway, which I mostly agree with rationally, despite my heart being in opposition most of the time.\nAnother lady told me about a quote said by our senior pastor once. After looking it up, it was a quote by Corrie ten Boom. There are multiple iterations of this quote, as really Corrie Ten Boom believed in the idea but said it in many different phrasings during her life. The general idea, however, was:\nHold all things loosely, because it will hurt if God must pry them out of your hands.\n- Corrie ten Boom\nLoss hurts. Change is hard. We like comfort and predictability, not things which are uncertain, new, or potentially dangerous. But God does not call us to live in the comfort of our possessions, our favourite albums, or spacious houses. God gives us things to build us up and enjoy, but will just as easily remove them from our grasp, for the sake of drawing near to him.\nI am planning on moving out soon, so the idea of letting things go has been on my mind. I want and I need to get rid of a lot of things before moving out. I am praying that God would help me loosen my grip, so that my loss will count as naught compared to the eternal treasures of heaven that God has in store.\nRelated:\nI am trying to hold my K-Pop songs loosely.

I am 99% sure that is bad git practice.\nI started with the PaperMod theme, and then tried using PaperModX for a bit, and then decided to switch back to PaperMod because 1. I figured out how to better use Hugo and 2. PaperModX had too many bugs for me. To build my site, need to use hugo -t PaperMod (or instead of PaperMod, the current website theme).\nTo customise CSS and HTML of a theme, you should override these rather than edit the themes files directly. The PaperMod files of my website were downloaded onto my laptop and edited directly, which I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done. For HTML, images, etc., you can create a new file in the folders of your actual site, rather than the theme\u0026rsquo;s folders. For example, to overwrite head.html stored in /my-site/themes/theme-name/layout/partials/ you can copy that file into something like /my-site/layouts/partials/ and then the content of that file will overwrite the original file. This is especially important if you have cloned a repository (but that\u0026rsquo;s kinda of obvious, right?). To do that but for CSS, I am referencing Banjo Code.\nhttps://www.banjocode.com/post/hugo/custom-css/\nHad to do this too https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65040931/hugo-failed-to-find-a-valid-digest-in-the-integrity-attribute-for-resource\nDid this https://bphogan.com/2020/08/11/2020-08-11-creating-unlisted-content-in-hugo/\nChanged markdown to render HTML with https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/ by changing goldmark renderer to unsafe = true\nIn head.html, changed something about favicon stuff because I moved my favicon files elsewhere and my website does not like it so seeing if this fixes it.\n{{/* \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;icon\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ .Site.Params.assets.favicon | default \u0026#34;favicon.ico\u0026#34; | absURL }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;icon\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ .Site.Params.assets.favicon | absURL }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Unsure how to nest functions in hugo yet.\nAdded URLS to the books of Bible overview pages so that instead of /46-1-corinthians/ being the end of the URL, it\u0026rsquo;s just /1-corinthians/ https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/.

I think chapters of the bible would make it too messy, but I think I could try and implement that in future. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t think Hugo has sub-taxonomies.

Free up yourself to serve others more? Simplicity Declutter Clothing Books Papers Komono (Miscellaneous items) Sentimental items Clothing Gather all items of clothing Touch each item and consider if they bring you joy whether owning the item glorifies God Create a \u0026ldquo;keep\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;throw out\u0026rdquo; pile as you go Thank the items you\u0026rsquo;ll throw out for their service Fold each item you\u0026rsquo;ll keep and give it a specific place (drawer, wardrobe shelf, wardrobe hanger) to live At the end, write down:\nWhich clothes were thrown out and why? Which clothes were kept and why? Other criteria Will this item get worn at least 30 times? Has it been worn at least 30 times? Does it fit personal style anymore? Is it versatile? How well does it go with the rest of wardrobe? Is it broken? Can you be bothered to mend it? Is it comfortable? List of clothing categories tops (for folding) bottoms (jeans, pants, skirts, etc.) pants shorts skirts clothes to be hung (outerwear, dresses, etc.) dresses outerwear pj\u0026rsquo;s sleepwear/loungewear undergarments (socks, underwear, bras, thermals etc.) socks stockings, tights thermals underwear bras bags backpacks purses that collection of plastic bags extra items (scarves, belts, hats, etc.) clothes for specific events (old shirts from specific programs, togs, uniforms, etc.) activewear swimwear uniforms jewellery and accessories shoes Books Collect all the books you own and create a pile Pick up your books, considering if they either spark joy or have a purpose whether owning the book glorifies God Create two piles: One \u0026ldquo;keep\u0026rdquo; pile, one \u0026ldquo;discard\u0026rdquo; pile Thank the books in the \u0026ldquo;discard\u0026rdquo; pile for the role they\u0026rsquo;ve played in your life Put the books from the \u0026ldquo;keep\u0026rdquo; pile back, neatly, in their original place At the end, write down:\nWhich books were discarded and why?

List of book categories general (books you read for pleasure)\npractical (reference, cookbooks, textbooks etc.)\nvisual (photograph collections, etc.)\nmagazines\nfiction\nChristian books\nnon-fiction (reference, textbooks, etc.)\nnotebooks\nPapers Gather the paper and paper documents you own Sort the paper into categories - e.g., one category for greeting cards, another for thank you notes, another for bills, and so on Begin with one category and make your way through Pick up each bit of paper in each category and read through them. If the paper isn\u0026rsquo;t valuable or is no longer necessary to keep, thank it for its service and place it in the \u0026ldquo;shred\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;burn\u0026rdquo; pile Discard the unwanted papers At the end, write down:\nWhich papers were discarded and why? Which papers were kept and why? Categories of papers Category one: Needs attention. These are documents that need to be looked at in a matter of hours or days - like a rental tenancy agreement form that needs to be signed. Category two: Are needed for the short-term. These are documents that need to be looked at again, but not immediately. An example would be a birthday card you need to write and send in the next two weeks. Category three: Are needed indefinitely. These are documents that need to be kept at all times, but not necessarily looked at often. The completed tenancy agreement contract, once you\u0026rsquo;ve fully-moved in, would be an example of this. Categorise Put remaining papers in categories for \u0026ldquo;needs attention\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;are needed for the short-term\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;are needed indefinitely\u0026rdquo; Place the papers in storage e.g. folders Choose a location for the organized papers to go At the end, write down:\nWhere was the first category of papers put? Where was the second category of papers put? Where was the third category of papers put? Komono (Miscellaneous items) Collect your home\u0026rsquo;s miscellaneous items It might help you to group them into certain piles - a pile for kitchen items, another for tech, another for lighting, and so on Do as you\u0026rsquo;ve done previously: Touch each item, consider if it sparks joy, and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, thank it for its service Consider each item\u0026rsquo;s value, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t wish to keep it, place it in a \u0026ldquo;discard\u0026rdquo; pile Place the items you\u0026rsquo;ll keep in its original place - if you can\u0026rsquo;t find a new, better place for it, that is! Discard the Komono items which aren\u0026rsquo;t needed anymore~~, or don\u0026rsquo;t bring joy~~ At the end, write down:\nWhich misc. items were discarded and why? Which misc. items were kept and why? Sentimental items Collect all sentimental items and put them in a pile in front of you One by one, see if the item in question sparks enough joy to keep, and if it needs to be kept or not Put the items that are no longer needed in a pile~~, thanking them for their service as you go~~ Organize the items you\u0026rsquo;ll keep and put them somewhere safe, like inside a storage box Discard the sentimental items At the end, write down:\nWhich sentimental items were discarded and why? Which sentimental items were kept and why? Maintain Changing Your Habits Only buy things you really need. And when you need something new, make sure it’s something you love.2 Discard things that have served their purpose but are no longer loved on a regular basis. If you are doing the laundry and realize a piece of clothing is no longer suitable or enjoyable to wear, go ahead and put it into a donation box right away.2 Make a habit of going through your clothes each season and discard those things you haven’t worn.2 When you make a purchase, designate a place for that new item when you get home. Don’t set it down and think about it later. Do it right away.2 Put things back as soon as you\u0026rsquo;ve used them. Actual thoughts I REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH STUFF. I know this. There are so many things I think about r.e. my belongings.\nHow much should I care about the things I have? I wish to [[Hold all things loosely]], but then at a point I feel like I would just store things up without caring whether I am in possession of them or not.\nMari Kondo has nice principles specifcally about the order in which you should declutter, i.e. I like her system, but I do not like her criteria for what should be kept vs. removed, nor do I like the Eastern spiritual elements of her practice. \u0026ldquo;What sparks joy\u0026rdquo; is a bit of a weird criteria if Christians are supposed to really find ultimate joy in God. I think we can delight in the things we own, but if we derive our joy from them, that\u0026rsquo;s prob bad.\nThere is this blog post I don\u0026rsquo;t fully agree with for the \u0026ldquo;items shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spark joy\u0026rdquo; reason.2\nReferences\nMain list from https://www.process.st/checklist/konmari-checklist/\nhttps://unconformedkitchen.com/spring-cleaning-5-decluttering-tips-for-the-christian-whos-overwhelmed-with-stuff\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://avirtuouswoman.org/should-christians-use-the-konmari-method/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://michaelacheong.com/decluttering/","summary":"6 things you should get rid of by Jenny Mustard https://youtu.be/i0mmVVVpAAg Things you don’t need, don\u0026rsquo;t love.\nMaybe one day Just in case \u0026lsquo;So-so\u0026rsquo; clothes \u0026lsquo;For now\u0026rsquo; (that we will use until we find or can afford the better version) \u0026lsquo;I should\u0026rsquo; (tools for improvement that make you feel bad about yourself) \u0026lsquo;If only\u0026rsquo; (we quit our jobs, but a nice house,…) Process/System Principles No need to store up treasures on earth [[Hold all things loosely]] No need to be anxious about clothing Someone may benefit from your possessions more than you would1 Do everything for God\u0026rsquo;s glory If you had to give an account to God for every item you own, what would God think?","title":"Decluttering"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://michaelacheong.com/archives/","summary":"archives","title":"Archive"}]
