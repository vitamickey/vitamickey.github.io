[{"content":"Welcome to my lil\u0026rsquo; digital garden! This is a place where I would like to learn and grow.\nSome places to start on this website would be my post about digital gardens or my first post So, it began on why I made this website.\nThings you should know before trekking through this site What I put here is a living, breathing garden. These things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned, ideas, opinions, essays, etc., are open to change, and open to growth. You can suggest edits to my notes on GitHub in the meta at the bottom of each post. I will try to enable comments soon too.\nNotes here are probably written for me and not for general public consumption, so, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that not everything will make sense. I like to make notes comprehensible enough for myself to understand, though, so hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s not too much of an issue?? Actually, as I have been working on this site, I am naturally making my notes more for general consumption than I intended to, and I guess that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nThere will be a variety of developed (evergreen) notes, vs. budding or growing notes. I would like to adopt some kind of metaphor for growth on this website (like maybe cocoons into caterpillars into butterflies, since I have chosen the butterfly for my website motif), but we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nDigital gardens are not really meant to be chronological or easily navigable. They should be densely linked to each other so that one can trawl through them similarly to how you would in a forest. I would like to get there eventually, but haven\u0026rsquo;t set up a good backlink system yet, so the archive is currently chronological as is the pagination from the home page.\nThis website will be a combination of a personal wiki and a digital garden. Some notes will be titled as things, some will be ideas and declarative statements, some will be abstract titles (I think I have been inspired by vlogbrothers in that regard), and some will be none of those things. If I think too hard about maintaining consistency in my post titles then I will cease to write anything at all.\nIn future, this might become a list of key notes for navigation purposes or to start off. idk.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/welcome/","summary":"Welcome to my lil\u0026rsquo; digital garden!

No amount of skill-building will help you become fluent.  A2: Roadmap Overview  Build a foundation  Use traditional learning tools for understanding purely (all input, no output). Immersion. Vocab and grammar to aid in comprehension and make meaning.   Develop comprehension  Narrow focus. Choose content that is most comprehensible to you and only study within that content. Develop into being able to understand native level content.   Learn to speak Refine to mastery  Starting is half the battle. The other half is to keep showing up.\nB: Mindset B1: Enjoy the Language Enjoying your immersion content is THE MOST important part of language acquisition.\nDo not force yourself to immerse with content you aren’t interested in.\nIf you’re bored, skip it.\nEnjoyment catalyses acquisition.\nRefold is PURELY A GUIDE\nB2: Tolerate the Ambiguity Get comfortable leaving your comfort zone.\nSkill-building DOES NOT WORK for language acquisition.\nStart slow and build endurance for trying to sit through immersion.\nC: Core Activities C1: Active Immersion Paying full attention to the content you are consuming.\nThe MOST important activity in language acquisition.\n Finding Content  Netflix and Streaming Sites YouTube Other Platforms   Tools  Language Learning with Netflix \u0026amp; YouTube Dedicated TL YT Acc Dedicated TL device    C2: Passive Listening You have plenty of time to do this, whilst doing other tasks like cooking and cleaning.\nReach for this instead of other content.\nRe-listen to content you have actively immersed with.\nGives brain a second chance to listen to same content.\nListen to the sounds of the target language.\nDon’t get discouraged by not understanding.\nIf you get bored, switch it up.\nC3: Active Study Grammar study shows us how to break down the language.\nMemorisation helps in the following three ways:\n Priming  Learning a new word creates a new entry in your mental dictionary. It primes you to recognise it during immersion.   Comprehension  Memorising the meaning of the word fills in the definition in the dictionary.   Retention  Once a word has been seen a lot in immersion, it becomes acquired vocabulary, which is harder to forget. Each dictionary entry must be revisited before its deletion, otherwise you have to build it back up in your memory.    Use an SRS to retain information.\n So, use Anki  Stage 1: Lay the Foundation Foundation is important!\nStage 1A: Setting Up Tools and Habits A1: Active Immersion Aim for 30min/day in TL.\nCan use subtitles in NL to help increase enjoyment of immersion whilst building habit of consuming TL media. Stop using NL subtitles once habit is built.\nAccept ambiguity. It will feel hard/discouraging, but that’s part of learning.\n Limit NL subs Rewatch content you know Watch simpler shows Make it a game  Sounds Words Search for known words (mental dictionary entries)    A2: Passive Listening Quantity and repetition. Replace all that you listen to during mindless tasks with listening.\n Whilst travelling, walking, exercising, doing chores, during morning or bedtime routines Reduce friction by downloading resources)  Listen for words and sounds. It might sound like gibberish, but that’s part of the process.\nA3: Anki Setup Anki setup guide\nBy the end of Stage 1A, you should have Anki set up and you should be immersing with Target Language (TL) content.\nStage 1B: Learning the Building Blocks B1: Phonetics B2: Writing System By the end of Stage 1B, you should be aware of the phonetics of your TL and should have started or completed studying the writing system. For languages with vastly different writing systems than your NL, you should have set up a daily habit of studying the writing system.\nStage 1C: Jumpstarting Your Comprehension C1: Grammar C2: SRS Best Practices C3: Vocabulary By the end of Stage 1C, you should be studying grammar and vocabulary on a daily basis.\nThe goal of Stage 1 is to prepare you to learn directly from your immersion.\nBefore moving on to Stage 2A, you should feel comfortable enough with your TL\u0026rsquo;s writing system that you can do lookups when reading subtitles.\nYou should be engaging with your TL every day and feel comfortable watching media that you don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nYou should also be regularly studying vocabulary, though you don\u0026rsquo;t need to finish learning all 1,500 words before moving on to Stage 2A.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/refold/","summary":"To-do  Create TL language YouTube account.

Yes:\n Juvia\u0026rsquo;s Place in I think J18? A touch grey as well. Texture was nice on my skin.  No:\n Hynt Beauty Medium Tan. Used it a while ago and it worked for shade but not for texture as much.  Maybe so:\n KVD Good Apple Concealer Medium 141. Haven’t purchased (only used sample) but is a perfect match for my skintone, a true olive leaning yellow. Probably will purchase during a year with a special occasion bc MONEY.

Too orange? Which is annoying bc it’s supposed to have olive undertones. Idk, like, I got away with it, but it really is quite orange on me, and a tad dark.  Maybe so:\n Kosas Face Oil in 5.5?

Bought on a whim from CW, and it’s the perfect subtle but hydrating colour for everyday. Can literally wear in any situation. Pat McGrath Mattrance? In Flesh 3. It’s super nice, but not CF. Bought secondhand off Reddit.  Yes:\n Colourpop:  Cutie Fruity Cherry Pickin Lay over is a smidge pink for me but still works   Rituelle de Fille:  Written in Blood. It\u0026rsquo;s a really nice product and the bold blue-based red actually kinda worked for me. Didn’t lean orange, which is something I look for in a bolder red lipstick.

Think of it as pop psychology.\nTo participate in the Trauma Olympics is to partake in the competition of \u0026ldquo;who has experienced the worst trauma?\u0026rdquo;. What metrics are used? Quantity (how many events, for how long) and quality (how bad was it). This is not a great culture to participate in, but I have found myself falling victim to it from others and equally perpetuating it onto others.\nWhen talking about traumatic experiences in life, if others around you have experienced seemingly worse things than you, you can either feel within yourself a minimisation of your own experiences, or be explicitly told, \u0026ldquo;your experiences are not as bad as mine have been\u0026rdquo;. A negative consequence of this is the feeling that one is not allowed to feel as poorly as they do about what they have been through because of its relative okay-ness to those around them.\nIf you sense you have had worse experiences than others, as I often do, you may possibly minimise your own experiences to give others space to share their lesser experiences, or you may tout your own trauma so as to feel better about the sorry state of your life. I do both of these, much to my chagrin.\nReally, I think the solution to the many pitfalls is to be empathetic to one another. If someone is going through something traumatic, or is healing from past trauma, simply be there for the person. Listen, clarify, ask questions, refer them to professionals who can help, check in with them.\nHere is a list of things I avoid saying or doing when someone are sharing emotions, experiences or trauma with me, from my own personal experience of feeling minimised or unsafe in a conversation, as well as what I\u0026rsquo;ve found seems to work:\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone has experienced hardship and goes through tough times.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Look on the bright side: what didn\u0026rsquo;t kill you made you stronger.\u0026rdquo; Talking about how you relate to someone\u0026rsquo;s hardship can sometimes be unhelpful, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t actually experienced similar situations to them, but this varies and depends a lot on the people talking.  For example, for a person talking about their experience with trauma from sexual assault, if the person they are sharing with responds with \u0026ldquo;I can relate, because I have felt pain and trauma during break-ups\u0026rdquo;, that may not be helpful, as those two experiences objectively differ a lot. Not to say one pain is worse than the other (we are trying to avoid that) but there are objective differences between those situations that make the \u0026ldquo;I relate to you\u0026rdquo; sentiment feel ingenuine or misplaced.   \u0026ldquo;But you seem fine, so are your difficulties really that bad, or are you just playing them up?\u0026rdquo;  Everyone feels their experiences differently. The way I feel, experience and deal with past trauma and ongoing traumatic events is totally different to the way my friends would, because everyone has an individual experience of the world and different capacities for dealing with problems. The Trauma Olympics are not helpful, useful, or loving. Let\u0026rsquo;s see each other as individual people and get to know others and their experiences, in love and care for one another, and not in competition against each other.\n Further reading\nWelcome to the Trauma Olympics by Anne Davis\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/trauma-olympics/","summary":"Disclaimer: totally based on personal experience, and not properly researched.

I would eventually like to add some basic key definitions and ideas here, but this is a quick-start guide to\u0026hellip;\nHow to shop more ethically: The Basics There are a few guidelines you can use to make better purchasing choices.\n1. Buy fewer clothes The first thing is just to buy fewer clothes. We all have lots of clothes, and probably don’t need to buy more, so reducing consumption and wearing the clothes you have til their bitter end is the best step. This has a positive environmental impact as well as it ensuring your money isn’t going to the wrong places.\n2. Buy secondhand If you need to buy clothes, try secondhand first. You are normally supporting a charity when you guy secondhand, and you can often find cooler pieces for way cheaper than they would retail.\n3. Buy new but ethical/sustainable If you have decided you need clothes and wish to buy them new, there are some websites that can help you figure out where they stand ethically.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know what\u0026rsquo;s actually sustainable?\u0026rdquo; Grading systems There are websites that grade brands:\n Goodonyou: https://goodonyou.eco/ is the main website with some good blogs, https://directory.goodonyou.eco/ is the actual brand ratings site. Baptist World Aid: https://baptistworldaid.org.au/resources/ethical-fashion-guide/ Fashion Revolution Transparency Index: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/  You should take the gradings with a grain of salt, and you can read up on how they grade brands if you want a better picture of what the ratings mean.\nOther websites and blogs (i.e. Google searches) There are websites that compile ethical brands in blog posts or lists, but it’s always a good idea to look on a brand\u0026rsquo;s website for how transparent their manufacturing process is, look up any articles or opinions about controversies (just googling or searching on Reddit for the brand name). Some websites include:\n Britt\u0026rsquo;s List: https://www.brittslist.com.au/, nice because it\u0026rsquo;s based in Aus Eco Warrior Princess: https://ecowarriorprincess.net/  You can always google \u0026ldquo;ethical swimwear brands in Australia\u0026rdquo;, or replace this with other keywords, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find various google articles to comb through.\nThird-party certifications (Note: in response to my friend\u0026rsquo;s message about how there is lack of plus-size clothing at affordable prices)\nYeah for sure. I think you\u0026rsquo;d be interested in brands like HoMie or Afends, tho idk how well they do with larger sizes There are also various projects, movements or third-party certifications you can look for: Ethical Clothing Australia: https://ethicalclothingaustralia.org.au/ Who Made My Clothes/Fabric?: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/get-involved/ Certifications include B-Corp, GOTS and OEKO-TEX\nIn general, I find it enjoyable to research different brands and stuff. It’s just part of the natural process of my interest in fashion and also ethical or sustainable purchasing. So, if you enjoy the hunt, the process is quite easy. In fact, maybe I spend a little too much time looking into these things lol\nI wanna start a blog soon so I might make some more handy guides like this. (Note: see: this website)\nTip: Know what you like It also helps to know what style of clothes you like: colours, fabrics, styles, cuts, etc.. If you know your style, then you are more likely to buy clothes that you will wear for longer, and thus decrease the need for you to buy more clothes\nTip: Take care of the clothes you own Also, taking care of the clothes you have is important\nA few brands Afends Case study: Is Afends sustainable?

You should buy clothes with the intention of using them, loving them, and either passing them on to someone else before they\u0026rsquo;re dead if you don’t have a use for them, or using them until they’re falling apart at the seams (in which case, you can get your clothes repaired or tailored, and repeat the previous step until you can literally not wear them anymore)\n(Note: in response to my thankful friend who asked about this in the first place)\nGlad I could help :george:\nOn second-hand shopping: other ethical ramifications On the secondhand thing, you can also shop vintage if you have the means, or shop on websites like eBay, FB marketplace, depop, gumtree, etc., as some people are uncomfortable with buying from op shops when people who actually don’t have the means to spend more could’ve bought those op shop items\n(I personally don’t have an issue with op shopping, since most op shops are inundated with donations anyway, and a lot of op shop stock has to go to landfill if it doesn’t get sold)\nBrisbane vintage clothing stores I’ve been to include Arkive (Garden City, Chermside), SWOP (West End), Neo-Generalist (West End, in particular more expensive than other places). There are plenty of other vintage stores and op shops if you just search on Google or on Google Maps\n im still a “sustainable brand” hater honestly and think i can find everything i ever need on depop lol vintage clothing stores are always overpriced which is disappointing - my correct cousin\n Yeah this\nLike really, you can find literally anything you want on depop\nI don’t mind shopping vintage because 1. I get to try on clothes in person which means they’re 100% going to fit me and it’s not going to be a guessing game 2. Because if you buy something for $30 on depop and then you pay $10 shipping that\u0026rsquo;s pretty comparable to depop pricing anyway in some cases?\nI would not buy vintage on depop because most of it is overpriced AND you can’t try it on, which is sort of a lose-lose Don’t discount eBay. Here is a really good video about shopping on eBay. https://youtu.be/enl5LVszMRw. Since watching this video, I have bought a very cute top on eBay\nTo Be Honest, if I’m looking for stuff on depop, I’ll buy Uniqlo or Glassons for basics bc I like a lot of the basic cuts and styles from them and I can get my sizes from the brands by trying on their clothes in store. And I\u0026rsquo;m looking to buy some secondhand Rollas jeans too. Moral of this tidbit is if you have a fast fashion brand you like, you can probably pick it up from depop if sizing is an issue\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/ethical-fashion/","summary":"To be honest, this note was one of the main reasons I wanted to make a website: so I could easily link friends and family to resources about ethical fashion, without me necessarily dumping an entire essay into their DMs. This is just the compiled texts I sent to the main university Discord server I hang out in when the topic of fast fashion came up and people started asking, \u0026ldquo;How DO I stop shopping for fast fashion?","title":"Ethical fashion"},{"content":"I think you call this a stack, where you talk about applications you use and their setup.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (1 John 2:15–17, ESV)\n We have recently been having small groups discussions after church on Sunday evenings as part of our services. It has been wonderful to meet people around the church and engage with them in learning about God\u0026rsquo;s word and being. In our small group time, I got to talk with a couple of the older ladies and an older man from around the church. We were given a question stack similar to, \u0026ldquo;Do you have any favourite things/possessions? Is it okay to have nice things? If God asked you to get rid of them, would you do it?\u0026rdquo;.\nI expressed how I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling with taking care for the things I consume in relation to media (i.e., movies, TV shows, music, etc.). I have favourite movies or favourite music, but am unsure whether I would be able to give them up, and often wonder whether they are even helpful (see 1 Corinthians 6:12 and All things are lawful\u0026hellip;).\nOne lady talked about how must stuff is rubbish anyway, which I mostly agree with rationally, despite my heart being in opposition most of the time.\nAnother lady told me about a quote said by our senior pastor once. After looking it up, it was a quote by Corrie ten Boom. There are multiple iterations of this quote, as really Corrie Ten Boom believed in the idea but said it in many different phrasings during her life. The general idea, however, was:\n Hold all things loosely, because it will hurt if God must pry them out of your hands.\n- Corrie ten Boom\n Loss hurts. Change is hard. We like comfort and predictability, not things which are uncertain, new, or potentially dangerous. But God does not call us to live in the comfort of our possessions, our favourite albums, or spacious houses. God gives us things to build us up and enjoy, but will just as easily remove them from our grasp, for the sake of drawing near to him.\nI am planning on moving out soon, so the idea of letting things go has been on my mind. I want and I need to get rid of a lot of things before moving out. I am praying that God would help me loosen my grip, so that my loss will count as naught compared to the eternal treasures of heaven that God has in store.\n","permalink":"http://michaelacheong.com/hold-loosely/","summary":"On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.\n Do not love the world or the things in the world.
