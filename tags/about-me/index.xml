      <description>Origins of the name Michaela Michaela
n. who is like God
Feminine form of Michael (from Hebrew).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaela
A girl from my Youth group wrote this out on a card for me in nice hand-lettering and gave it to me when I got baptised in March of 2021. I honestly hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought about the meaning of my name until then, though I knew that I had been named Michaela based on the biblical angel Michael.</description>

<p>I am definitely not like God. But I do grapple with identity sometimes.</p>
<p>How much of my identity comes from the right things? My identity as a child of God and follower of Jesus might be at the centre of my identity, but how much are my interests, struggles, ideas, appearance, a part of who I am? I would not be who I am without those things, and in a sense they define me, but can I ultimately ascribe my identity as a person to them? I&rsquo;m not sure I know the answers to any of these questions.</p>
