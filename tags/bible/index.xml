Mentor: if you come on too strong or judge them too harshly, they will just retreat from you and stop coming to you for advice. Avoid that.
I think I’ve already done this. But I’m gonna try and lovingly reconcile this.</description>

      <description>I feel like a lot of stuff I have been reading or hearing has been about love. That makes sense, given love is the core of who God is. God IS love. Of course I am learning a lot about love.
The classic is 1 Corinthians 13. Anything without love is nothing.
Let all that you do be done in love, 1 Corinthians 16:14.
Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</description>

      <description>17/06/2022
Today, I started reading 2 Corinthians, and like, wow. There are times when I am in awe at God&amp;rsquo;s word, but this was a time where I was TRULY felt so in awe of what I was reading.
In the first half of 2 Corinthians 1, Paul talks about the afflictions and suffering he&amp;rsquo;s gone through. There are a few key truths I have taken from this:
Suffering makes us learn to rely on God I have gone through a lot.</description>

      <description>Some key reasons:
If I have time to eat, I have time to read. John Piper things to commit to in your 20&amp;rsquo;s
I am fickle. Coffee &amp;amp; Bible Time video - I need to read daily because I have a pretty bad memory.</description>

      <title>Praying out loud builds up others</title>
      <link>http://michaelacheong.com/praying-out-loud/</link>

      <guid>http://michaelacheong.com/praying-out-loud/</guid>
      <description>1 Corinthians 14 talks about prayers in tongues. If you pray in tongues, but it is not interpreted, then like, even though it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to pray, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve to build others up in prayer since they don&amp;rsquo;t know what you prayed about. They cannot join in saying &amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; to a prayer that is unknown.
This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve pondered a bit, when I notice people who are inclined to never praying out loud corporately, whether in a small group or in a large group.</description>

      <title>The Bible provides models for articulating responses to our situations</title>
      <link>http://michaelacheong.com/bible-models-responses/</link>

      <description>I get the feeling that this is kind of obvious, but I am talking about instances where I have read a passage and gone, &amp;ldquo;Wow, the way that the author talked about their emotions, thoughts, situation, etc. is something I would like to adapt into my life too.&amp;rdquo; So, basically these are all from the epistles but whatevs.
From Youth camp, Romans 7:21-25. Models a response to our own sinful nature.</description>

      <title>It is better to marry than to burn with passion</title>

      <description>This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today.
To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)
Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey. Onwards we go.</description>
