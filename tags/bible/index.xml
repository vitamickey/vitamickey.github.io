      <description>17/06/2022
Today, I started reading 2 Corinthians, and like, wow. There are times when I am in awe at God&amp;rsquo;s word, but this was a time where I was TRULY felt so in awe of what I was reading.
In the first half of 2 Corinthians 1, Paul talks about the afflictions and suffering he&amp;rsquo;s gone through. There are a few key truths I have taken from this:
Suffering makes us learn to rely on God I have gone through a lot.</description>

      <title>The Bible provides models for articulating responses to our situations</title>

      <description>I get the feeling that this is kind of obvious, but I am talking about instances where I have read a passage and gone, &amp;ldquo;Wow, the way that the author talked about their emotions, thoughts, situation, etc. is something I would like to adapt into my life too.&amp;rdquo; So, basically these are all from the epistles but whatevs.
From Youth camp, Romans 7:21-25. Models a response to our own sinful nature.</description>

      <title>It is better to marry than to burn with passion</title>

      <description>This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today.
 To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. (1 Corinthians 7:8–9)
 Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey.</description>

      <description>On Sunday, we went through 1 John 2:12-17, however, 1 John 2:15–17 is a bit more relevant to this thought.
 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</description>
