+mushroom, -chilli, +chilli flakes. one FAT western eggplant was more than enough. still have the seedy flesh from the middle. tried new fancy cooking wines and vinegars uwu. house smells nice.
I didn’t have any chilli unfortunately but did chuck in some gratuitous chilli flakes at the eleventh hour
Technique (sort of) from https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/eggplant-with-garlic-sauce
underestimated food prep time. my cooking skills are still very basic.</description>

I think Aunty Elsa gave me tips the year I made the cha guo! (N.B. sweet cha guo with red bean seems to be a Hakka recipe https://bymargk.blogspot.com/2018/04/sweet-hakka-cha-guo-with-red-bean.html)
Here’s what she wrote to me&amp;hellip;
Hi Julia I never made those but it&amp;rsquo;s same dough as Jin doys. Just have to use pink colouring roll into balls and fill with Do SAR (red bean sweet paste from a tin) or.</description>

Recipes Eggplant [[2022-08-09]]
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-eggplant/
I did 200°C for 20min, flip, and then 10min. Canola oil and salt, on aluminium. Eggplant chunks surprisingly large going into the oven. Those bad boys SHRINK. Also, I put zucchini, which def needed to be smaller slices (lower moisture content?? but generally tougher flesh).
