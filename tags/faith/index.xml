      <description>Hate your sin. Despise it. This is war.
Battle verses Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.‚Äù
Matthew 26:41 - ESV
Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.</description>

      <description>I am a Christian. What does that mean?
What I believe, basically wip.
There is one God, the one who created that thing you may know as the Bible. Our world was created by God, as have each and everyone one of us. But humanity has fumbled pretty hard. Instead of listening to God, we decided, as Gabriella Montez in High School Musical 2 once said, that we gotta go our own way.</description>

      <title>Being a Christian university student</title>

      <description>I had a massive crisis in the middle of my first year of uni. As I grew in my faith and left high school (which was pretty bad for me), I became disillusioned with the idea of studying. What is the point of me spending this time in uni, studying for a degree that isn&amp;rsquo;t a theological degree? I could spend all day studying my Bible but instead I must study linear analysis?</description>

      <description>I feel like a lot of stuff I have been reading or hearing has been about love. That makes sense, given love is the core of who God is. God IS love. Of course I am learning a lot about love.
The classic is 1 Corinthians 13. Anything without love is nothing.
Let all that you do be done in love, 1 Corinthians 16:14.
Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</description>

Today, I started reading 2 Corinthians, and like, wow. There are times when I am in awe at God&amp;rsquo;s word, but this was a time where I was TRULY felt so in awe of what I was reading.
In the first half of 2 Corinthians 1, Paul talks about the afflictions and suffering he&amp;rsquo;s gone through. There are a few key truths I have taken from this:
Suffering makes us learn to rely on God I have gone through a lot.</description>
