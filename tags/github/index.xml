      <description>I am an absolute GitHub noob, but like, I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best.
When I created this website, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I should have created the hugo new site in a cloned repository that was already on my computer, so, I am using the second answer of this stack overflow question to do it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311774/how-to-convert-existing-non-empty-directory-into-a-git-working-directory-and-pus

<p>My .gitignore file came from here
<a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Hugo.gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Hugo.gitignore</a>
I am only semi-confident in my .gitignore file for the website, but like, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
