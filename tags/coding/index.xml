      <description>I am an absolute GitHub noob, but like, I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best.
When I created this website, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I should have created the hugo new site in a cloned repository that was already on my computer, so, I am using the second answer of this stack overflow question to do it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311774/how-to-convert-existing-non-empty-directory-into-a-git-working-directory-and-pus
After some finicking, I now have my Hugo site version control being managed in Git. I think.</description>

<p>When I created this website, I didn&rsquo;t realise I should have created the <code>hugo new site</code> in a cloned repository that was already on my computer, so, I am using the second answer of this stack overflow question to do it.

<p>My .gitignore file came from here
<a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Hugo.gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Hugo.gitignore</a>
I am only semi-confident in my .gitignore file for the website, but like, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>

      <description>I already have broken my website.
I started with hugo new post/so-it-began.md to create my first post, and then tried to change the folder &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;posts&amp;rdquo;, added a second file with hugo new posts/digital-garden.md, and now it&amp;rsquo;s not showing up on my website. lol.
Thanks to this video for the setup guide tho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4
I am a bit unnerved by the fact that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t merge to the main branch via a pull request and instead commits straight to the main branch.</description>

<p>I am a bit unnerved by the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t merge to the main branch via a pull request and instead commits straight to the main branch. I am 99% sure that is bad git practice.</p>
<p>To build my site, need to use <code>hugo -t PaperMod</code> (or instead of <code>PaperMod</code>, the current website theme).</p>
<p>I need to</p>
<ul>
<li>add comments with Disqus <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/</a></li>
<li>make a stubs page?? <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/stubs/">https://www.mtsolitary.com/stubs/</a> <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/">https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/</a></li>
<li>BACKLINKS??? lol I have a death wish <a href="https://gabrielleearnshaw.medium.com/implementing-backlinks-in-a-hugo-website-e548d3d8f0e0">https://gabrielleearnshaw.medium.com/implementing-backlinks-in-a-hugo-website-e548d3d8f0e0</a> <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/">https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210329232300-mt-solitary-stack/</a></li>
<li>a search with filters like hugo tania or Maggie Appleton&rsquo;s website would be cool
&ndash; an option to see my posts related to any book of the bible, maybe</li>
<li>ordering by last tended, not by date planted</li>
<li>proper implementation of horticultural extended metaphor</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>To customise CSS and HTML of a theme, you should <strong>override</strong> these rather than edit the themes files directly. The PaperMod files of my website were downloaded onto my laptop and edited directly, which I shouldn&rsquo;t have done. For HTML, images, etc., you can create a new file in the folders of your actual site, rather than the theme&rsquo;s folders. For example, to overwrite <code>head.html</code> stored in <code>/my-site/themes/theme-name/layout/partials/</code> you can copy that file into something like <code>/my-site/layouts/partials/</code> and then the content of that file will overwrite the original file. This is especially important if you have cloned a repository (but that&rsquo;s kinda of obvious, right?). To do that but for CSS, I am referencing Banjo Code.</p>
