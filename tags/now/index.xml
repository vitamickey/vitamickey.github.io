Fonts, typography, favourite fonts Mathematics, subjects I&amp;rsquo;m taking, transfer statistics knowledge onto digital garden maybe?? High school, reflections, why it sucked (i.e. having mental health but as a high achiever) Music, instruments Crochet, yarn and hook stuff Anything from Notion that I sort of don&amp;rsquo;t want in Notion anymore (I am a bit sick of Notion) A rant about Notion Anki setup The difficultiy I have in sticking to systems Bullet journalling (Ryder Carroll basics) Stationery How I feel about receiving flowers as gifts K-Pop?</description>
